			 <p>I see Trump’s &ldquo;Big Beautiful Bill&rdquo; has passed. I think it will ultimately cause more harm than good. If it works the way it’s supposed to, I should personally benefit from the overtime provision and maybe, in a couple of years, the new car interest tax rebate. But I also know a lot of people it will hurt. 🤷‍♂️</p>
<p>As a no-party-affiliated voter who leans just right of center on most issues—and definitely left of center on healthcare—I’ve always believed we should have universal healthcare. 🏥 I don’t have all the answers, and I’m not sure how we’d fund it or make it work in a way that’s both sensible and doctor-patient centered, but I believe it’s the right direction.</p>
<p>I think the cuts to Medicaid are harmful. I’m not totally against work requirements, as long as they’re applied equally and fairly to people who aren’t disabled in any way.</p>
<p>And once you factor in looming tariffs and the removal of undocumented farm and construction workers, I think inflation will come roaring back. 📈 Any breaks I might get will likely be eaten up.</p>
<p>That’s just my two cents.</p>

			 <p>I start my first dose of Camzyos tomorrow to see if it helps with my obstructive HCM symptoms. I’m a bit nervous 😟 — there are a lot of black box warnings ⚠️. I have my first follow-up ECHO next month 🩺.</p>
<p>What worries me most, though, is that while insurance has approved the medication and the company provides the first 35 doses free 💊, I still haven’t been set up with my insurance’s pharmacy — and no one has told me what my out-of-pocket cost will be. I’m afraid I’ll start this medication and then find out I can’t afford to continue it 💸.</p>
<p>And to make it harder, it can take up to three months to even become effective ⏳.</p>

			 <p>Lately I’ve been dealing with some heavy medical stuff related to a heart condition I’ve lived with for years: hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). It’s a rare condition where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, making it harder to pump blood efficiently — and unfortunately, it’s been getting worse.</p>
<p>Despite medication, my symptoms have progressed to the point where even walking short distances has become difficult. My cardiology team is working hard to get me approved for a new medication called Mavacamten, which offers real hope for people with this specific form of heart disease. It doesn’t work for everyone, but it’s a big step forward compared to what used to be available.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t help, I may be looking at more invasive options like a septal myectomy — a type of open-heart surgery that could relieve the obstruction and help me breathe and function more normally again. It’s a lot to process, but I’m thankful to have a solid medical team and good care options.</p>
<p>For now, I’m taking things one step at a time — literally and figuratively. Just sharing a bit of what’s going on behind the scenes for those who follow along here. Life doesn’t always move in a straight line, but I believe there’s purpose in the detours too.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been meaning to blog about this for a couple of months — the Howard Frankland Bridge, which was part of what I considered my first real job and career in my early twenties.. I crossed it often and saw it change over the years. For a bridge, it never really felt like one — at least not in the usual sense. It had (last I saw) scenic turnarounds on both ends that gave it a unique character.</p>
<p>I’ve been under that bridge by boat, and over it by car, and I always felt safe on it. But wow, traffic could get snarled in a hurry if something happened.</p>
<p>I’m including two photos — one from when the bridge first opened in 1960, and another from March 2025, showing the newly completed span. I don’t really know why this came to mind, except that I don’t have any bad memories crossing this bridge.</p>
<p>Now the Skyway Bridge&hellip; that’s a different story, and definitely worthy of a blog post on its own — coming soon.</p>

<p>After enduring betrayal, a rigged trial, brutal beatings, and the agonizing walk to Calvary—Jesus was crucified and laid in a tomb.
The skies had darkened. The veil had torn. And now, by Roman command, the tomb was sealed and guarded.</p>
<p>You know, the Romans went to great lengths to guard and seal a dead man.</p>
<p>If He was truly just a dead man, why post more than one soldier?
That’s because, I believe, they knew—deep down—this was no ordinary man.</p>
<p>Isn’t it ironic? They treated Jesus in death like a king.
They guarded Him in death the way He should have been honored and guarded in life.</p>
<p>But this King needed no earthly protection.
This <strong>King of Kings and Lord of Lords</strong> could turn someone to a pillar of salt.
Yet they treated Him like a common prisoner—worried not that He would be harmed,
but that someone would steal His body and turn Him into a legend.</p>
<p>What they failed to understand… was <strong>who He truly was</strong>.</p>
<p>Only a <strong>Savior</strong> sacrifices Himself for all of humanity—past, present, and future.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Luke 24:1–12 (ESV)</strong>
(24:1) But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared.
(24:2) And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
(24:3) but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
(24:4) While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.
(24:5) And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?
(24:6) He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,
(24:7) that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.”
(24:8) And they remembered his words,
(24:9) and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
(24:10) Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles,
(24:11) but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them.
(24:12) But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>When the tomb was found empty on that third day…
What do you think those Roman guards felt as they fled in fear and trembling?
What must they have thought after witnessing the angel roll back the stone and light up the sky like lightning?</p>
<p>And what about the women—arriving in silence and sorrow, only to find the tomb already opened and unguarded?
What must they have whispered to one another as they stepped inside?</p>
<p>I can’t wait to find out—as Paul Harvey used to say—<strong>“the rest of the story.”</strong>
And one day, at the Judgment Seat of Christ, we may know.</p>
<p>If you’ve accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, then <strong>you are alive today—for all eternity, indefinitely</strong>—because of what He did on that cross atop Calvary.
And if you haven’t yet accepted Him—you <strong>can</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>tomb was opened</strong>, and the <strong>stone was rolled away</strong>.</p>
<p>And today, we celebrate the most glorious truth in history:
<strong>The tomb is empty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Happy Easter.</strong>
Jesus—the Lord of Lords, the King of Kings, the Christ of us all—is <strong>alive and well</strong>.</p>
<p>And He’s <strong>waiting for you</strong>.</p>
<p>You do not want to be at the second judgment—the <strong>Great White Throne Judgment</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s just say… I stopped wearing it pretty quickly. 😅</p>
<p>I muted the device and put it aside — but not before it captured one of the funniest AI-generated summaries I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The device itself, called the <strong>Bee Pioneer</strong>, actually looks great 🐝. The idea is solid. I first heard about it from <a href="https://leo.fm">@leo</a> on one of his shows, and I figured it had promise — if it worked well.</p>
<p>So on Saturday, I went through my usual routine: watched some TV 📺, paid a few bills 💸, and muttered about the President and his latest round of tariff nonsense 🙄. Then on Sunday, I opened the Bee app to see what it had recorded and summarized from my day.</p>
<p>And according to <em><strong>Bee’s AI</strong></em>… this is what I did — all in a single day:</p>
<hr>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<hr>
<p>A little context: the “friend” mentioned was actually my brother. And yes, I am Michael. But the rest? That came straight from an old episode of <em>Hunter</em> 📺 that was playing in the background while I was doing other things.</p>
<p>Somehow, Bee’s AI blended my real day with gritty 1980s TV drama and decided I was in the middle of investigating a faked death 🕵️‍♂️, a dentist conspiracy 🦷, and $2 million in missing valuables 💰.</p>
<p>If I had actually done even one-tenth of what Bee thinks I did that day, I’d need to take the rest of the year off to recover. 🛌</p>
<p>In short? This thing is not ready for prime time. The Android app is extremely basic — and honestly, not great right now. But wow&hellip; what a laugh. I still can’t believe how confidently it generated this noir thriller summary of my otherwise chill weekend. 🤣</p>
<p>Imagine training a real AI model on stuff like this, thinking it’s an actual person’s daily life.</p>
<p>Hope you laugh as hard as I did. 😂</p>

<p>Over the last few months, I’ve gotten into the home lab/server kick—mostly to learn, do some things for myself, and finally put to use a lot of the computer tech I’ve collected over the years. (I’ll make a blog post about that in the future.)</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve been thinking about how to make better use of my collection of over 700 DVDs and Blu-rays. I recently bought a Plex Lifetime Pass right before the price doubled, and I think it was a good investment. I know I could use Jellyfin, but not all of our TVs support it—whereas they <em>do</em> support Plex.</p>
<p>I’ve started adding newer DVDs and Blu-rays to my system in preparation. I’m moving back to physical media and away from streaming services because of all the nonsense—shows and movies disappearing for arbitrary reasons, content being pulled without warning, and the fact that you’re only licensing what you think you own. Well, guess what? I <em>do</em> own the physical media.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my question—and where I need some guidance: <strong>What kind of NAS should I get?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t think my Raspberry Pi 5 with 8GB will be sufficient (it’s already being used for other things). I currently have a Synology BeeStation for our photos and a limited set of backups, and it works well as a simple solution. But what about movies and comprehensive backups?</p>
<p>Should I go with Synology, UGreen, or some other brand? If I roll my own, should I use something like a Zimaboard? (I’ve been looking at that.) I’m a bit stumped. I’d like something with software that’s actively developed and regularly updated. I’m just unsure.</p>

			 <p>I went to my cardiologist today for my last visit with him. Dr. Patrick Chang of the University of South Florida is moving to Orlando, FL, and leaving the university, so if you&rsquo;re looking for a great cardiologist, he&rsquo;s definitely one to consider. His fellow will be taking over for him, and I like him too—plus, he&rsquo;s young, so I should be seeing him for the next 20 to 30 years or more! 🙂</p>
<p>The news I got today is that they want me to see a cardiomyopathy specialist at USF. I&rsquo;ve been feeling tired all the time, and I&rsquo;m already on the maximum dosage of my medication combo for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. My last ECHO showed some improvement, but my left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient is still elevated at 55 mmHg.</p>

			 <p>You know, the Republicans through Trump and Musk have found the key to cutting money to everyone but their rich owners and hiking taxes in the form of tariffs so they can say they don&rsquo;t raise taxes. But a tariff is a tax.

<p>I really need a new chair. I bought a <strong>Secretlab Titan</strong> chair in 2020 at the height of the supply shortages and COVID-19. I had to wait a few months for it and paid almost <strong>$500</strong>. I figured that since I work remotely a couple of days a week and would be sitting in it when I’m home from work, it would be a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p>I should have done more research.</p>
<p>For the first year, the chair was alright—the seat was a little uncomfortable, but the backrest and headrest were fine. Fast forward three years, and one day, while sitting in the chair, I suddenly found myself on the floor. One of the base spokes/feet broke and sent me tumbling.</p>
<p>To their credit, Secretlab sent me replacement parts, but ever since then, the chair has been going downhill. The hydraulic cylinder is failing—if the chair is facing a certain way, it sinks all the way down. The armrests are also wearing out and becoming rough.</p>
<p>I say all this to emphasize that I want and need a new chair. But with the current state of the U.S. economy, I’m hesitant to make a purchase right now.</p>
<p>Plus, what should I get? I’ve been leaning toward Herman Miller or Steelcase since I want something comfortable and long-lasting.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

			 <p>You know, I think the media should pull all their coverage and reporters from the White House. Trump thrives on media attention. I know Fox News, Newsmax, and OAN won’t, but the people who watch them 24/7 wouldn’t care anyway. All we’re getting is lies, half-truths, and garbage as it is.

<p><strong>A Little History</strong></p>
<p>I started blogging back in 2001, beginning with Blogger—probably like many others at the time. I remained on Blogger even after Google acquired the platform in 2003. However, I wasn’t a prolific blogger back then. Instead, I focused on maintaining a personal website where I frequently updated content, mainly pictures. At the time, I used my ISP’s residential web hosting service, which was included in my package, and built my site with Microsoft FrontPage. I became very proficient with FrontPage and really miss it—but I digress.</p>
<p>When Microsoft FrontPage was discontinued and ISP-provided web hosting started disappearing, Blogger remained. So, I began using it more and more. I also started using Microsoft Live Writer—another great tool that unfortunately disappeared.</p>
<p>For many years, I stuck with Blogger. Later, I experimented with WordPress, but I found it difficult to use and wasn’t impressed. Then came all the hullabaloo surrounding one of WordPress’s creators/owners. After dealing with the chaos at Twitter under Elon Musk, I was eager to find alternatives.</p>
<p>I considered sticking with my Blogger account and began posting there again, alongside using my self-hosted Mastodon instance, which I had set up to replace Twitter. But it just wasn’t the same.</p>
<p>After researching Write.as and Micro.blog, I debated whether to just stay with Blogger. In the end, I decided to do all of them.</p>
<p>First, I signed up for Write.as. Then, a few days later, I joined Micro.blog. I subscribed to the paid plans on both platforms to explore their full features.
<em>(Write.as will be the subject of a separate post soon.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Discovering Micro.blog</strong></p>
<p>As I started digging into Micro.blog and figuring out all its features, I was really impressed. I like how it seamlessly combines blogging, social media, and web hosting.</p>
<p>That said, the platform leans heavily towards the Apple ecosystem (macOS and iOS). There’s a web editor, a macOS app, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and even a Firefox extension for bookmarking sites—but no Windows app.</p>
<p>I’ve structured my Micro.blog site to resemble the layout I once had on my FrontPage-built site (with one key exception, the photo gallery ). At its core, I now have a fully integrated blog. Federation handles the social media aspect.</p>
<p>Micro.blog not only federates with Mastodon, Pixelfed, and Bluesky, but it also connects with Meta properties (like Threads) and Automattic services (like Tumblr). Additionally, you can import content into your blog via RSS feeds, turning various sources into blog posts automatically.</p>
<p>Since I use a custom domain with Cloudflare, I was happy to see that Micro.blog works well with Cloudflare DNS. Setting up a custom domain with Micro.blog was seamless, and Cloudflare’s security features provide an extra layer of protection.</p>
<p><strong>User Experience &amp; Mobile Apps</strong></p>
<p>Micro.blog is built on Hugo, users who are comfortable with Hugo’s templating system can deeply customize their sites. While the default theming is simple, those familiar with Hugo can modify templates, tweak layouts, and enhance functionality. For those who aren’t as comfortable with coding, Micro.blog’s built-in themes and plugins offer plenty of flexibility.</p>
<p>Micro.blog has a vibrant plugin community. There are a lot of third-party themes from <a href="mattlangford.com">Matt Langford</a> and <a href="jimmitchell.org">Jim Mitchell</a> (not related, as far as I know). You can host podcasts with Micro.blog and send newsletters.</p>
<p>For mobile users, there are apps for both iOS and Android. Since I primarily use Android, I can’t speak much about the iOS apps, but the Micro.blog Android app feels feature-rich.</p>
<p>Micro.blog also offers companion apps, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Epilogue</strong> (for book tracking)</li>
<li><strong>Strata</strong> (for notes)</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s also <strong>Sunlit</strong>, a photo-sharing app for iOS, and an Android version is expected in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We aren’t planning to develop a Windows app for Micro.blog, but I would like to have an Android app for Sunlit one day. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Ideally, all of our mobile apps would be available for both iOS and Android.</p>
<p>If you find a good standards-based app for Windows that works with Micro.blog, let us know! We can link to it from Micro.blog so more people know about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Micro.blog&rsquo;s federation features have made me reconsider whether I really need to maintain my own Mastodon instance. While I still appreciate some of Mastodon’s features, like boosting or favoriting posts, the managed hosting I have through Masto.host has been fantastic.</p>
<p>I have already imported my Mastodon following list to Micro.blog, which would make a transition smoother in the future if I decide to shut down my Mastodon instance. One of Micro.blog’s biggest advantages is POSSE (Publish Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere), allowing me to post on my own platform while automatically syndicating content to other networks. This makes my decision about whether to keep my Mastodon instance an interesting one for the future.</p>
<p><strong>The Downsides</strong></p>
<p>While I’ve found plenty of positives, there are a few negatives—though I really had to dig for them.</p>
<p>The writer/editor is not What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG). From what I can tell, it’s a mix of HTML and Markdown. Since I’m not well-versed in either, there has been a bit of a learning curve. The editor is especially difficult to navigate when adding pictures. You can&rsquo;t place them inline, which makes it challenging (at least for me) to determine where the images will end up in the final post.</p>
<p>To work around this, I’ve started composing longer posts in Obsidian (a Markdown editor) and using the online writer/editor for shorter posts. Currently, I am using Typora (I recently bought it). I think, as far as writer/editors go, Scribbles has the best I have ever seen—it is extremely user-friendly.</p>
<p>The Android apps seem to be full-featured, and the only negative I’ve noticed is with Strata. I can edit notes created on the web and create notebooks, but I can’t create new notes from the Android app. I’ve reported this, as I believe it’s a bug.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<p>What could make this platform better, or what features would I like to see? Honestly, not much. But a few things come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>A better web writer</li>
<li>A Windows app on par with the macOS app (my dream)</li>
<li>A way to sort people I follow by platform (i.e., Micro.blog, Mastodon, Bluesky, or others)</li>
<li>An easy way to create a photo gallery that isn’t tied to a blog post and can be added to navigation</li>
<li>A way to hide the default photo page (this might just be something I need to learn how to do)</li>
<li>A Mastodon-style share extension plugin for Firefox</li>
<li>Easier category management (editing, renaming, and reorganizing)</li>
<li>Support for tags to better organize posts</li>
<li>Hashtag support for social media cross-posting (so hashtags in a Micro.blog post properly transfer to Mastodon, Bluesky, etc.)</li>
<li>Ensure images display consistently across different post layouts, avoiding issues where images appear off to the side in two-line view but display correctly in three-line view (similar to what I experienced with Scribbles, which was reported).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these features may already be supported, and I just need to learn where they are and how to use them. If so, I welcome any pointers from the community!</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>
<p>For my needs and wants, Micro.blog is an 8 out of 10. Like Masto.host, this is an independently owned service with a beautiful array of features, constant development, and refinement. One of the things I appreciate about Micro.blog is its strong integration with IndieWeb principles, including support for Webmentions and POSSE. This keeps my content under my control while still allowing me to engage across the web.</p>
<p>Manton Reece, the owner and creator, seems committed to fostering a positive community. The pricing is reasonable:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1/month (Micro.one)</li>
<li>$5/month (Micro.blog)</li>
<li>$10/month (Micro.blog Premium)
(With yearly plans available.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The community is very engaged, and Manton isn’t just involved in the product but also the community.</p>
<p>It amazes me how one person can manage improvements, upgrades, support (though he now has help), community engagement, and keep up with the ever-evolving IndieWeb and social media landscape.</p>
<p>Unless Manton lets this platform wither—or worse, turns into another entitled owner (like Matt Mullenweg, Elon Musk, or Mark Zuckerberg)—and as long as I have the income, I can see this being my permanent home.</p>

<p>Technology can be amazing and frustrating at the same time. It kind of reminds me of the media—hold on, you’ll see where I’m going with this comparison.
I have a Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 and an Oura Ring 3. I wear both to track my sleep and heart health because I have sleep apnea and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p>The problem? Both devices give me different sleep data almost every night. Take last night as an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Samsung Health reported a sleep score of 94 (Excellent). A detailed breakdown is below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
</li>
<li>
<p>Oura Ring 3 reported a sleep score of 74 (Good) with a sleep efficiency of 88%. Further breakdown is below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, which do I believe? While both ultimately say I slept well (and I did—I can feel it), their numbers don’t match. I tend to stay up late on Friday nights to decompress from the past week, catching up on TV, PC gaming, emails, bills, and other things. Still, I slept great. But which device is more accurate?</p>
<p>I wear both because I’m in the Samsung ecosystem, and I already had the Oura Ring before the Samsung Ring was released. (I’m waiting for version 2 or 3 of the Samsung Ring before I jump in, so they can work out the bugs.)</p>
<p>This brings me to my comparison with the media.
I watch Fox News for local updates and ABC News for world and U.S. news. I also check in on Newsmax here and there—mainly to keep up with my parents, who now have it on 24/7 (something I’ve warned them about). Just like my watch and ring, each news outlet presents similar information differently—sometimes slightly, sometimes drastically.</p>
<p>So, which do you believe?
I’ve realized that, just like with my sleep trackers, you have to compare the data and come to your own conclusions.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve concluded:
I don’t know which device is more accurate, but both agree that I slept well. This is further confirmed by my CPAP machine, which recorded zero AHI events (apnea episodes). In the end, I feel rested, and that’s what really matters.</p>
<p>Likewise, I don’t trust any single news source completely. I listen to all sides, recognize the kernel of truth in each, and make my own informed decisions.</p>

<p>This week, I’ve been reflecting on an upcoming medical procedure scheduled for Monday—a routine colonoscopy. While the procedure itself isn’t bad, I truly dread the day before. Preparing for it is unpleasant, but I know it’s necessary for my health. Since I’m high-risk due to previously discovered benign polyps, I need to have one every 3 to 5 years. It’s an expense I’d rather avoid, but it’s essential for peace of mind.</p>
<p>I’ve also been contemplating blogging. Writing has always been a cathartic outlet for me, a way to process my feelings and reflect on life. It’s interesting to look back on how my thoughts have evolved over the years—some things have changed, while others remain constant. In a way, my blog posts capture my growth and maturing.</p>
<p>Even if no one reads my writing, that’s okay. Who knows? Maybe a hundred years from now, someone will stumble upon my words. Perhaps they’ll laugh, cry, or even pause to think.</p>
<p>Now, if only I could get back into reading this year.</p>

			 <h3 id="my-television-habits-have-changed-drastically">My Television Habits Have Changed Drastically</h3>
<p><img src="https://mlm361.micro.blog/uploads/2025/5bp-man-sits-couch-watching-netflix-hbo.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I was thinking the other day about how much television I used to watch. I used to sit down about a month before the new TV season began, just after Labor Day, and map out all the new shows—what nights they were on and when they were starting—so I could watch them. I would then make a note or create a makeshift calendar for when the TV shows I watched were returning and check out new shows.</p>
<p>Then, in the days when I had a TiVo and later a DVR, I made sure everything was set to record each episode in case I was working, so I could watch it when I got home or had time off.</p>
<p>I barely watch TV anymore, and when I do, it’s usually reruns of old TV shows on live TV. Most of the new series I watch are on streaming platforms, but even that is becoming less frequent.</p>
<p>The main reason streaming is falling off for me is that there’s no longer a set month or day for new seasons to return. It can take over a year or even two for a new season to come out. Then, when they do drop a new season, many streaming services only release one episode per week. This isn’t like traditional TV, where there was a set schedule with other shows or programs in time slots before and after. With streaming, just give me the whole season, and let me watch as I please. I do applaud Netflix for this—they drop the entire season at once, and you can binge-watch it all at your own pace.</p>
<p>Now, with streaming, you’re lucky if you get 8 to 10 episodes. As I mentioned earlier, the next season is often 1 to 2 years away. This is a far cry from the old days when TV series seasons consisted of 15 to 25 episodes, often with a bonus episode or a Christmas special. The season would start just after Labor Day, take a small break around Thanksgiving, and then return in January or February, depending on the Super Bowl. After the “Big Game,” it would return and end just before Memorial Day in May. Then, there were a few short new shows that returned for a couple of months. Streaming originally filled this gap, if I remember correctly. But now, with streaming, by the time the new season starts, I’ve either forgotten about the series or moved on.</p>
<p>Today, TV series as a whole have a discovery problem. It used to be that new shows were advertised heavily, with TV networks holding specials detailing upcoming TV series, offering previews, or providing news stories on the web about what was coming. If they still do this, I don’t see it anymore.</p>
<p>I say all this to explain why my TV habits have changed. I find myself watching less TV than ever before, and when I do, it’s usually an old TV series. I also find myself watching more YouTube. Most of my YouTube watching is dedicated to learning about things like how to make use of my Raspberry Pi for home servers, networking, web development, and computer-related topics. I wish I could truly learn to code and write programs.</p>
<p>Well, this rant is over. Have your TV habits changed in the last few years? I think the TV industry is failing to adapt and be creative for this new generation of TV watchers—and it’s losing them as a result. Part of the problem is not taking into account how people want to watch, and not having enough content and seasons ready to go in a timely manner. I know that many schedules were disrupted by COVID-19, but it has been two years since the pandemic officially ended, and life has returned to normal. Some industries and occupations, however, have not readjusted. I also think the issue is partly due to greed—viewers are tired of the relentless push for more ads. Every service I subscribe to, I purposely choose the ad-free version. But now, even ad-free isn’t truly ad-free, and that turns me off. To make matters worse, the constant price increases add to the frustration. Some services are raising prices multiple times in a year, not just every year or every few years.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t know if any traditional TV will be left in the next few years.</p>

			 <p>Easter is a time of great celebration for Christians all over the world. It marks the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the son of God, after he was crucified on the cross for the sins of humanity. This event is the cornerstone of the Christian faith and is seen as a symbol of hope, love, and redemption.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Bible teaches that Jesus was crucified on the cross, buried, and then rose again three days later. This event is recorded in the New Testament in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. In Matthew 28:6, it says, &ldquo;He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.&rdquo; The resurrection of Jesus was a physical, tangible event, and his disciples saw him alive after his death on the cross. This event is the foundation of the Christian faith and is seen as proof that Jesus was who he claimed to be — the Son of God.</p>
<p>The resurrection of Jesus has far-reaching implications for believers today. First, it provides hope and assurance that death is not the end. Through his resurrection, Jesus defeated death and offers eternal life to all who believe in him. In John 11:25-26, Jesus says, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.&rdquo; This verse provides hope and assurance that death is not the end and that believers will have eternal life with God.</p>
<p>God loved humanity so much that he sent his only son, Jesus, to die for our sins. Through his death and resurrection, Jesus took the punishment for our sins and made a way for us to be reconciled to God. In Romans 5:8, it says, &ldquo;But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&rdquo; This verse reminds us that God&rsquo;s love is unconditional and that he loves us despite our flaws and mistakes.</p>
<p>Finally, the resurrection of Jesus provides a foundation for our faith. Through his death and resurrection, Jesus shows us that God has a plan and purpose for our lives. He offers us the hope and assurance that, no matter what we face in this life, we can trust in God&rsquo;s sovereignty and love. In Colossians 2:13-15, it says, &ldquo;And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.&rdquo; This verse reminds us that, through Jesus' death and resurrection, we have been forgiven and made alive in Christ.</p>
<p>Easter is a time of great celebration and a reminder of the significance of Jesus' death and resurrection. It provides hope, love, and a foundation for our faith. As we celebrate this holiday, let us remember the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross and the hope and assurance that his resurrection brings. Let us embrace his love and make him the cornerstone of our lives. #Easter #Resurrection #SacrificeOfJesus #Christian #Hope #Love #FoundationForFaith</p>

			 <p>Happy New Year and let&rsquo;s hope 2022 is better. 2021 was a terrible year for me compared to 2020 believe it or not. Even though 2020 was the start of Pandemic it was a better year for me personally. As far as New Year&rsquo;s resolutions I don&rsquo;t do that but would like to read more this year. Well that is it for now. Hope everyone stays safe. </p>

			 <p>It is the end of an Era for the Mitchell Tribe as I have sold the Inverness Property I inherited from my Grandmother. I tried to hold onto it until I could fix it and improve the land with a new trailer but after 12 years and money lost I sold it. I remember spending my summers up there with my Grandmother and my family going up there and watching the fireflies and walking up there and being able to just relax. In the last few months, I have not been relaxing but have been stressing about the property as the &ldquo;new&rdquo; neighbors were squatting and illegally storing stuff in a run-down trailer. So rather than put up with the next door hooligans I sold the property at a significant loss. I believe that the group I sold it too will improve. So The Mitchell&rsquo;s bid Citrus County a farewell.</p>

Either it was a bioweapon that went wrong or they need strict sanitary laws for those wet markets if it was truly crossed that way. This is the third respiratory virus that has originated from China (SARS, MERS and now Covid19). China at a minimum needs to forgive our national debt total to them.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Those are my opinions and thoughts right now.

			 <p>I have been thinking lately about a lot of things broadband related. If telecom and cable companies don&rsquo;t start investing in building out high-speed internet they are going to lose. When Starlink and OneWeb and even if Kuiper gets up and running they are going to lose a good portion of there customer base depending if these low orbit satellites residential price is right.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Centurylink and Frontier will definitely be bankrupt and probably under Government control.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
For instance, I inherited a piece of property in rural part of the Country. The fastest internet I could get there is only 15/1 ADSL2+.  However, it might be more viable to me with gigabit internet with low latency. Just my two cents.</p>

Google&rsquo;s event I am kind of not looking forward too. I like the camera advancements I have been hearing about. Google why can&rsquo;t you leave the fingerprint reader, add a headphone jack and an FM tuner that would make it a big BUY for me. I know Google is planning to announce other things, but I have several Google devices and like every one of them. I wish the would simplify the privacy options by having one setting choice so that I could saw delete all my maps, history and other information collected after 18 months.

			 <p>I find myself watching more old TV shows lately. I have recently started to watch The Waltons. I remember them when I was growing up, but it was not the main show. I have really enjoyed watching Season 1 on Amazon Prime. I have been enjoying watching old shows on Over the Air TV shows like All in the Family and Frasier. Sometimes I think that the old shows are better than most TV shows they come out with today and when I do get invested in one of the new shows the cancel it.</p>

			 <p> have been thinking a lot lately about how everything is or wants to go to the cloud. I think the only thing that should be in the cloud for sure is back up. Otherwise, I prefer to have everything locally. I know that companies are pushing us to the cloud/remote storage for subscription fees and never-ending revenue for them. The internet situation in this Country is not very good. I am lucky to live in an area that has broadband (although both the companies that can service us are not the greatest). I could also settle with music in the cloud and streaming it (as this is not bandwidth intensive).<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Watching the Microsoft E3 Xbox Presentation today, I did realize something that might be worth thinking about in the future. With as powerful as the next generation Xbox will be next year on its release and keyboard and mouse support added (not a big controller fan). People can own a cheap to moderately priced PC/Laptop and the next-gen Xbox and come out cheaper than having a full-blown gaming PC. I am seriously considering this in the future. The only thing that would keep me from doing that at this time is I am heavily invested in the Steam store/eco-system and modestly invested in the Epic store and EA Origin platform. Plus all the games I have on disk. If there was a way to bring them over at no charge I will become fully invested this way. I would love just having a nice laptop and the Xbox (with mouse and keyboard) for my gaming system.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
In the above scenario, I still would like to have local storage. That way I am not dependent on internet access. I would like to get out of the city/suburban area and go to a rural area if fiber was ubiquitous. Well, just me thinking out loud. What do you think? </p>

			 <p>I watched Google Stadia announcement today. I think this is a great idea but it suffers from one major drawback. Internet connections. A lot of people do not have high-speed internet and it is getting worse. If you do have high-speed internet, some people have data caps (which is ridiculous for a broadband connection or really any connection). The third and final issue is reliability. No matter what your ISP/Broadband connection is going to go down from something at some time. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
For the first two items, I think Google, Apple, Amazon, Disney, CBS, Netflix, and Microsoft should make a separate entity sort of Hulu like for wired fiber. Wired fiber is the best option in the long run low maintenance cost and will last decades. Or they could split up grants like the various City, County, State, and Federal Government agencies do to expand broadband from electric coops and telephone coops. All I know unless broadband expands to all corners of this Country these services are not going to work. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I know that in Paris, Tennessee and Inverness, FL where I have property since they are rural there is no Broadband available. Satellite is not a viable option for gaming. Which brings us to the third item I like having everything local and back up to the cloud. The gaming and movie watching I can live within the cloud but it has to be RELIABLE 99% and there needs to be a way to have a local copy just in case the 1% happens. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Just my two cents.</p>

			 <p>Hurricane Irma came to visit today, here in Brandon, FL. As I type we are still experiencing it. It is getting worse, but not as bad as predicted. Thank you Lord. If it had been as bad as predicted who knows what may have happen. The State gave us almost no warning time if we wanted to evacuate, work also dragged their feet and kept waiting to know the exact path. Even though it was already known that Hurricane Irma was wider and longer than the entire State of Florida. By the time everyone realized that we were going to get the brunt of the storm all the gas was gone or extremely hard to find. If you did find gas you may not have found anymore by the time you got out of the State, even if you then decided to leave. Then there wasn&rsquo;t anymore plywood because it was bought up or sent to the east coast. So again thank you again Lord for sparing us the absolute worse as my family chose to stay here.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I want to say for the majority of the storm and it still is not quite over, we had power and internet. So thank you TECO and Frontier. I posted a short clip of video of the storm I made for my Mom on my Twitter account. Take care all and now the clean up begins.</p>

The actual operation on my heart was a success. My heart is giving me no problem. I did wake up and it felt like it was on fire. However, that quickly went away. The anesthesia I had and tracheal intubation was a different matter. Ever since I woke up I am having a lot of phgleam, extreme sore throat and coughing up bright red blood in the phgleam. I have been intubated before and have never had a sore throat like this. This is constant sore throat. Well, lets hope tomorrow brings relief.</p>

			 <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I know I haven’t blogged in a long time or even updated my website. I am finding it hard to learn a new web design system. Blogging no excuse. But the main purpose of this blog is to wish everyone a Merry Christmas!</p>
<p>Remember the reason for the season, Jesus.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!!!!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p>Quote of the Day:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Comedy is tragedy plus time.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&ndash;Carol Burnett</p>
<p>Luke 2:11-14<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
“Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.” Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.””

I was really not impressed with either candidate this year. I look forward to when Huckabee runs again. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I just got my first report card for my Pharmacy Technician program.

			 <p>Well, I am getting real tired of politics and the politicians in this Country. I am not voting for Obama for sure and I don&rsquo;t like McCain. I personally do not like either choice. However, I know where McCain is coming from. Obama is a great Orator but that is it. When pressed he is never specific. I also fear he would give into other nations because he is afraid to get us in a war even though it maybe for the right reason. The Iraq War was wrong to start but we must finish it or breed a 1000 more terrorist that will hurt us. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We need people in Congress who is going to not only say he is going to look out for the &ldquo;little guy&rdquo; but recognize who the &ldquo;little guy&rdquo; is and start telling big business about their many unfair business practices.

It cost them almost nothing to run these things and if I bank with Bank A and go to Bank B because it is closer I should not have to pay. Because I can guarantee you that a Bank B customer will use Banks A ATM and it works out in the end. That is just one of the number of ways Americans are being bleed dry by Corporations. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have a book full.</p>

			 <p>Hello everyone, I started school last week. I am going to Brewster Technical Institute for Pharmacy Technician. So, far so good. I know I have not blogged or updated my website in a while. But, I have been pretty busy the last couple of months doing several things. Getting ready for school (i.e. physical, getting clothes and supplies). I have also been getting things ready to probate my grandmother&rsquo;s estate so that my Aunt and me can get what was left to us transferred legally. Plus, I have been trying to lose weight. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On those notes, school&rsquo;s start was successful. This is going to be a rough program but I am learning a lot. Secondly, I see the Probate lawyer tomorrow and hopefully after paying approximately $2000 get Grandma&rsquo;s estate done. That leaves the weight. I lost 14 pounds initially. I have gained 2 back but holding steady. I need to go down again. I had to start taking Metformin because by glucose reading was on the border line. My doctor did not want me to get Diabetes type 2. If I lose enough weight and keep it off I could stop taking the medicine. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, that&rsquo;s it for now. I promise sometime in the future, maybe this weekend, I will get the website update.</p>

I will move on to the next stage in my life as far as jobs/careers in the next few coming months or weeks. I will let you all know what develops. As of now I am just a civilian once again. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, I am off. I am now going to go to my niece, Alexus' School Christmas concert.</p>

I have found several horses I like ranging from $800 to 2000. Camels are little more expensive ranging from $550 to $10000. I wish I could retire today.</p>

			 <p>My favorite time of year is coming between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Hopefully, I will get a transfer in my job. I will keep you posted. Nothing new with me right now. Except on the medical front. I started taking a diabetes pill, Actos. Not that I have diabetes or pre-diabetes. But, my glucose has been 103 the last couple of times and it should be under 100. So, the doctor stated he wanted me to try this medication for 3 months to see if it helps with that and my fatty liver. They have found that by giving the pill before hand you are 70% less likely to get diabetes. I have also started dieting. Basically eating less. I gave up colas over a year ago and drink just water and tea. Though sometimes it is sweetened tea. The majority of the time I drink unsweetened tea. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, I hope everyone is doing fine.</p>

			 <p>First of all this is going to be a rant. I was watching channel 52 ABC family, one of my new favorite shows of Kyle XY, and the the channel goes blank. So, I check the other TV. Yep, it is blank too. So, I call Brighthouse to let them know. After spending 15 minutes on the phone, I get this nice lady who says &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard of a problem with that channel. But, I schedule you an appointment to have a technician come out to your house to check your cable.&rdquo; I state there is nothing wrong with the cable. Both TV&rsquo;s are doing it and all the other channels are fine. It is the signal. &ldquo;Well we have to schedule you an appointment for a technician to come and check the schedule.&rdquo; No please don&rsquo;t because by the time they get here someone will figure out the channel is down and fix the problem. Don&rsquo;t you people have someone control room monitoring all the channels? No response. Just let them know the channel is down. Thank you and goodbye. The channel then comes up for about 10 seconds then goes out again. Customer service and technical support need to improve at corporations as far as letting one hand know what is happening and then post for customers to know immediately. Not 5 days after the problem is fixed.</p>

			 <p>Well, I was supposed to work all weekend. That didn&rsquo;t happen. I went to the emergency room Thursday night and was admitted to the hospital. I finally got released on Saturday Afternoon. I even passed out in the emergency room and bit my lip. I don&rsquo;t remember passing out. But, I do remember the lip because it hurt when I woke up. The diagnosis is unclear. I believe it was either food poisoning or diverticulitis. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The emergency room personnel, according to my dad, were treating me like it was a heart attack. I knew it was not that. All because I said my chest hurt. My chest hurt because I had be vomiting for an hour before going to the emergency room. So, the final outcome: I feel better and looking forward to going back to work. I have 3 doctors appointment next week for follow up. Oh and by the way no heart attack that was ruled out almost immediately.</p>

In fact, the Deltec homes have survived Charley in Florida which we went through and Katrina. I won&rsquo;t have to worry about hurricanes in Tennessee but I will have to worry about Tornadoes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, this coming month will be a very busy month as you can see by my calendar.

			 <p>I went to the Doctor today as a follow up to my endoscope and colonoscopy. The verdict a polyp was removed from my colon and was benign. The growth in my stomach was Helicobacter pylori a bacteria that could cause me to have an ulcer. So, he wrote out a prescription for Prevpac. I take it for the next 14 days go back in 6 weeks and see if it killed the bacteria. Other than that I will have to have a colonoscopy every 3 to 5 years just to make sure there are no more polyps. My labs were showing elevated liver enzymes indicating a fatty liver. The only cure for a fatty liver is losing weight. So, I am going to have to start a modest and I do mean modest diet with modest exercise. I want to personally lose about 40 pounds. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I took the prescription to Publix to get it filled they had to order it and it should be here tomorrow. I refused to use Walgreens anymore. I have had several negative experiences with them in the past. I do have to use them for my mail order because that is who the insurance uses. But, that is as far as I am going. I will use Publix and CVS if I need anything from a 24 hour place. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One last thing, I am heading to Greeneville, Tennessee next week to look for some land.

			 <p>I had to have an endoscopy and a colonoscopy today. This is after several months of my primary doctor telling me that my liver tests in my blood work were coming back abnormal. My primary doctor sent me for a ultrasound of the liver and then an MRI of my liver with another ultrasound. The diagnoses with the ultrasound and MRI was a minimal fatty liver and a benign polyp in my gallbladder. Well, my doctor was going to start me on Tricor to lower my triglycerides. However, after another abnormal liver blood test sent me to a gastroenterologist. He had me go to Labcorp and I gave 9 vials of blood. Well, guess what. Some of the tests were abnormal. But, no hepatitis A, B or C. Which I knew was negative. Well getting back to my scopes today. I had a good experience at the place it was performed and the doctor is very good. He did find a growth in my stomach and my colon. He biopsied both. I do have diverticula in one area and I have hemorrhoids. The later I knew I had. I got to see color pictures of everything. I am going to ask when I see him on February 9th if I can have a copy of them. His office is supposed to call me and let me know of the outcome of the biopsies. I feel fine except at the top of my stomach it is a little sore. Probably where he did the biopsy. I will keep everyone informed.</p>

			 <p>I started to watch the DVD Sin City. This is a horrible movie. I give it minus 4 stars. I stopped it halfway through and immediately put it up for sale on Amazon. I was shocked when I sold it the same day. I will be working Wednesday and Thursday. I will be working Saturday night into Christmas Morning. So, Merry Christmas to everyone.</p>

I watched Charlie and the Chocolate Factory earlier in the day and I only give that movie 1 out of 4 stars. The remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not as good as the original. In fact, it is horrible. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, today is also my last day before I go back to work. I do mean back to work too.

			 <p>Happy Thanksgiving Eve to all! I am doing great. I lost my land I was trying to purchase in Paris, TN but it fell through. I look at this as a sign that the Lord did not want me in Paris, TN. I am still looking in Tennessee for property to retire on and will be making another trip in February 2006 to the Eastern part of Tennessee in the area of Greenville, TN. I will keep everyone posted. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Henry went to the Eye Vet again today for a checkup. So far so good. The Eye Vet did advise he has a small detachment in the eye of the retina. But, as long as he is not uncomfortable and it is not bleeding so we will continue on his current treatment. That is good news. The bad is if in the future something worse happens his eye will have to be removed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On other new, I have plenty of new DVD&rsquo;s I am going to watch this weekend. I also have plenty and I do mean plenty of magazines to get caught up on too. I went and saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I was very very good. But, the ending could have been a bit stronger. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well for now that is it. Everyone have a great Thanksgiving and don&rsquo;t eat to much.</p>

			 <p>Well, I have been extremely busy at work. Nothing different there. Everyone asks did you get your land yet. The short answer is no. It looks like due to Fifth Third Bank&rsquo;s stupid advice I have lost by land. There is one last ditch effort in place. If it doesn&rsquo;t work. I lose about $1100. Don&rsquo;t worry though I am going to see a lawyer and see if it possible to recoup it from Fifth Third. I am also looking at backup properties in Tennessee. Just in a different area.

			 <p>Well, I am trying to buy that land in Tennessee that is shown on my webpage. I have been dealing with Fifth Third Bank for going on 2 months now. Still no deal. Well, today I was told that the loan has been approved all along. But, due to sickness at the bank or the appraisal not being done, we would have to delay closing. Well, the day before the actual closing the banks up and calls and states well this trailer that is on the land has to be moved first. Well, I said you people knew about the trailer and said it was ok that the seller have 30 days from closing to remove the trailer. Now it is not ok and the seller refuses to move the trailer first unless I give him 12000 in non refundable cash. Why can&rsquo;t things just work like the supposed too.</p>

			 <p>My cell phone hinge broke on Monday. Tuesday, I went into the Sprint PCS store and I thought I would be in for a great debate and verbal argument over my phone. Nope, I was pleasantly surprise. They ordered me a new phone since it was under manufacture&rsquo;s warranty and I added the total protection in case my replacement phone broke for any reason. So far I have had a great experience with Sprint PCS for wireless. I just got an advertisement for their new EVDO card for laptop access. I am weighing whether or not I would sign up. I am not quite sure yet. I just wish they would add a tower or two in Paris, Tennessee. Then I will be all set.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->But, on the same token since GTE became Verizon. I have had great service with them especially their Fios Internet Service. I have had an occasional hiccup with this or that with Verizon. But, overall, not bad with all their services I subscribe to. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Work has been rough lately. They changed my shift so that I can help train new hires. I got a slight bump in pay that is always good. Hope everyone else is doing great. Please keep my cousins, uncles and aunts in Connecticut in your prayers.

			 <p>I can not wait for this month to be over. I am sick and tired of all this bad news. Today, I wait all day for the Verizon worker to get to the house to install mine and my dad&rsquo;s new Fiber connection. We are supposed to get 2 separate connections. Well, the guy shows up at 4:30 PM and acts like he doesn&rsquo;t want to really install the fiber because it is going to take him at least to 7:00 to 8:00 PM. Second of all he tells me that he is going to only install 1 line. I tell him no he has a work order to install 2 separate lines. He tells me that this is impossible. They only dropped one line from the box to the house. So the house can only have 1 data line. I tell him nope that was not explained to us and we were getting two separate lines. So, I tell him to forget it. I call Verizon and they give me some lame excuse. So, I told them to cancel the order. They have me so mad right now. I am contemplating dropping them all together and just use my Sprint Cell phone all the time and getting cable for my internet access. This would save me alot of money.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Second thing that ticked me off today. I need to get a ultrasound of my liver so I call a couple of places. The first lady was extremely rude. I call another they were helpful, but ultimately I got sent to a voicemail. So, I leave a message and as of yet have not received a telephone call back.

When I am at work, I tell people straight out, Sir or ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t know. But, I will check for you or you might check with so and so or even, I am sorry this is not going to help you, but I don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t want to give you any bad information.</p>

			 <p>Well, I went in today and had my yearly physical. The checkup minus lab work went great. The doctor said only without the lab results yet I need to lose weight. Other than that he would have to wait for the lab work. However, I am headed for blood pressure and possibly cholesterol medicine if I do not lose weight based on last years blood result. I call back in a week to find out the blood work (lab) results.</p>

I am going to be able to take the money at the end of this month and pay off a bill and a half. My goal of becoming debt free is coming closer and closer. My house buying is coming sooner and sooner like my retirement <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also have been able to rest on these last couple of days off and already looking forward to Monday and Tuesday, my next days off. By the way speaking of Henry. I had to take him to the Vet yesterday. It seems he caught Kennel Cough during his stay at the Vets while I was on Vacation. He is on an antibiotic for the next 14 days. He will fully recover, Thank God!</p>

			 <p>I went to the doctors today. My blood pressure in my left arm was 150/104 by the nurse. The doctor came in and I was seeing him about a different problem. He checked me for that and then gave me refills on my prescriptions. But, I had to bring the blood pressure up to him. He took it and got a high reading in the left arm then took the right arm and got 132/85. It has been high since I started seeing this doctor for the past couple of years. He stated he did not want to start me on anything unless my readings stay consistently high. I have a complete physical in June 2005. So we will see what happens then. I will be trying to work a lot of overtime the next few months to save for Christmas. But, I wish doctors were better. I have a good couple of specialists (i.e. my allergist and my eye doctor) those are the only 2 I really trust.</p>

			 <p>Wednesday, April 6, 2005. We left and have arrived home from Disney World. I was disappointed with MGM and the Caribbean Resort. We did not have hot water our entire stay. It was luke warm. I like more hot than cold in my showers. MGM was kind of boring other than the 2 rides we went on it wasn&rsquo;t worth seeing. The Magic Kingdom on Monday was extremely crowded, but I love the Philamagic show with Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse. That was a great attraction and the first time I had been there. Also on the plus side we had dinner last night at a German restaurant in Epcot&rsquo;s World Show Case. It was a buffet and excellent. It was not quite as good as the Red Lobster on my birthday, but was good. I would eat there again. By the way we ate at the Lonestar Steakhouse on Sunday night and it was horrible.</p>

			 <p>I went to Epcot today, my first time there. I loved it. I went on the Test track and Mission Space. The hype leading up to the ride on Mission Space was leaving everyone scared including myself. However, once the initial part of the ride was over it was a great ride. I just wished it was longer. The Test Track was much scarier. I posted a lot of pictures on the MOB via my cell. I have been tired all this week. I think it is losing that hour on Sunday. Anyone one else with me?</p>

			 <p>Well, Monday was my birthday. I went to the Magic Kingdom on day 2 of my get-a-way vacation. It was very crowded. I got very embarrassed as my mom and dad took me out to dinner at Reb Lobster. First of all, my dinner was excellent. But, the surprise and embarrassment came as my mom told our waiter, without my knowledge, that it was my birthday so Jamie and the crew came over and sung me Happy Birthday as he served me a piece of cake and ice cream. I turned several shades of red. I was so embarrassed. But the cake was good and so was the ice cream. Overall not a bad day. 36 years old, I getting middle aged. 4 more years and I am 40 and 9 years 9 months I can retire. Scary!!!!</p>

But, I was having a lot of trouble with it. So, I bought my own domain names and moved to hopefully a more reliable web host and a professional web host. I did my homework this time and found that this company has a solid reputation. So the new website can be found at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I am in the process of upgrading some pages in particular (i.e. the guestbook page). The guestbook page is not working properly right now and I am aware of this. I am having to learn a bit of website programming that I have not known before. So, it may be a couple of months before I have it up and running. I am also going to add a couple of other features as soon as I learn how. But, the rest of the site is up and running. So, I hope you will stop by often and enjoy. Also if you try to go to the old website on Verizon I will be loading a redirect page so you won&rsquo;t have to anything. Please give me feedback via E-mail to let me know how you like it.

Also, I getting tired of cable, satellite, cell phones companies and telephone companies raising their rates with these so called fees and taxes.

			 <p>I feel Oppressed. Oppressed by Corporate America!!! LOL!!! Someone at work told be because they were black and I was waiting and working hard that I was oppressing his people and forcing his people to sell stuff to my people. LOL. I told him he was crazy. I mentioned all this to because lately I feel the pressure of money. I have been cutting expenses like crazy. I have lowered my car insurance (they did it I did not ask). A couple of credit cards I got them to reduce the interest rate. I am thinking about cutting my cable services and lower that rate (though that one will only be a few dollars). I am looking for a way to get rid of or lower my storage fee payments. I have changed cell carriers and getting great service with more features than Nextel (I went with Sprint PCS) at a lower rate. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well that is my ranting and raving now. I want to get a lot of bills paid off this year. I hope the tax man doesn&rsquo;t oppress me and sets me free.</p>

			 <p>As I mentioned in my previous post I bought my self a SCP 5500 cellular telephone with built in camera. I discontinued my Nextel Service for several reasons. First and foremost cost, second the direct connect service on Sprint, called Ready Link is superior than Nextel&rsquo;s and lastly since the two companies are merging and my contract had been up for some time I went with Sprint. If you are not aware Nextel within the next 3 years will be converting everyone on Nextel&rsquo;s network over to Sprint&rsquo;s. So everyone will be back together eventually. Just one more thing my cell phone number did not change. The first week of January 2005 I will be sending a e-mail to all family and friends just to give them all my updated information. I do this once a year in case you lose it or something has changed. Take care and God Bless.

			 <p>Henry has gone in for cyro to the eye procedure. He will have it done tomorrow and have to stay at the Eye Vets for at least two days. He has lost almost all of his sight. The Vet believes (as do I) that he is seeing shadows or has very diminished sight. This should be the last surgery for him if it works. If it doesn&rsquo;t he will have to have the eye removed.

			 <p>Well, I took Henry to the Eye Vet yesterday. He stitches came out fine and the Eye Vet says all looks well on that front. However, his right eye the pressure has increased to 40 even after the increase in medicine. Unlike his left eye though his vision is good in that eye and it is clear. The Eye Vet has increased the only other medication he can to see if that will help. We go back in 3 weeks. I will have to take the day off or cancel a doctor appointment I have the following week and take him them. If the eye pressure increases or stays high I have 2 options both costly. One would be to try and use some type of cyro procedure on the eye to see if the glaucoma can be stopped and reversed (but no guarantees) the other have the eye taken out like the left. But, the last option makes Henry permanently blind although the cyro option could too. Either way his sight has just a few more months maybe 6 months to a year. At least when he loses the other eye he will be probably be healthier and happier because he will not be on such strong medication.</p>

			 <p>Today Henry had 2 Vet visits. The first to his regular Vet for his 6 month Proheart Shot (for heartworms). That visit with food and allergy medication along with the shot was $184. The second at the Eye Vet for his 6 month check up. We received good news reference the right eye it is doing fine with a pressure at 20 (not bad, no great but ok). However, the left eye which I have already spent ($2200) is in very bad shape. The two previous injections to kill the eye and keep any fluid from building up has failed. The Vet said this was a first. Usually after 2 shots no problems anymore. Henry is having the left eye removed for good next week. This will cost $800 and his left eye will be shut forever. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just when my finances were looking up with plenty of overtime from work it will be going to unexpected Vet bills and I am stuck in neutral again.</p>

However, my DSL went down Friday and getting Verizon to admit it was their problem took my 4 days 3 of them with little sleep. I finally had to call one of the field techs that has been out to my house before and ask him to help. 2 hours later on Monday he called back with someone on the line from provisioning and bing bang bam back in business. The lady at provision said one of the profile numbers were messed up and that had been happening alot lately. She asked me to try the DSL and it worked.

			 <p>I was just sitting here thinking. I know that I have not been back to Church in a while. Not really because I don&rsquo;t want to worship Christ. But, because of my job and because I always have been Introverted. I don&rsquo;t like being around people. Especially, strangers. It takes a while to get to know people and once I am comfortable with people I am fine. So, this is one reason that I do not attend Church. There are a couple of more. Also, due to my job, when I am off it is down time for me and I have to admit I like to be lazy which links back to reason one getting to know people takes a lot of effort and I have been disappointed on many occasions with people. Which brings me to my third reason. People lie. I don&rsquo;t mean a little &ldquo;white&rdquo; lie like that is a good color when it really is isn&rsquo;t, but hypocritical lying. I deal with liars on my job all day long. But, then does this mean my love for Christ is any less genuine. I think not. I constantly listen to Christian music and shows while working, via the radio. So, I get my spiritual renewal and food from that source. I read the Internet visiting Christian links to gather information. I read, via e-mail, daily my devotional. So, yes I am being fed. Yes, I know the reason to attend Church is not only to be fed Spiritually but to fellowship with the people bonded by the same things that bond all Christian. The salvation Christ the Lord has given us and we should draw strength in that.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The reason I bring all this up is I saw Passions for Christ a couple of weeks ago and it was an awesome movie. This movie can spiritually feed you for a while. It had me thinking tonight as every night, but more so tonight, that the suffering Christ submitted and allowed for me was unbelievable. I have to think that if I lived in the days that this happened and I know I would be follower of Christ back then to that I would have intercede somehow, even for a brief moment, to stop the pain and torture Christ had to endure for us. Yes, I know that I would have been killed but you know that would have been fine. Because I know where I am heading upon death. Death, even old age, these things don&rsquo;t bother me. Pain, torture to me and suffering that Our Christ went through, that bothers me. If you haven&rsquo;t seen the movie yet go see it. It was amazing to see and hear the audience. No one in the theater talked during the movie after the first 15 minutes. Some teenagers were sitting next to me and were laughing and talking and even making fun of the movies subtitles. But, after 15 minutes. There was absolutely no sound, other than the movie, and no one got up to go to the concession stand or the bathroom. The movie with it&rsquo;s message is painful but necessary to sit through and really realize what Christ endure for us.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well that was on my mind and I had to let it out.</p>

			 <p>I went on a blind date this is probably my fifth or sixth one and all have one thing in common. They were not positive experience. I mean as far as the other company I was with the couple that set it up that was a positive experience. I enjoyed meeting my friend&rsquo;s wife and enjoyed there company. But as far as the date. We did not talk that much and for a change they talked about their job all the time but not to me but to my friend&rsquo;s wife. We probably said 2 sentences to each other. We just did not click from the get go. Oh well. But, I definitely think that was the end of blind dates. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We did go see 50 first dates not a great movie but not bad earlier. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I did find supposedly a great compatible match from eharmony.

			 <p>I am off tonight and tomorrow then back to the work world for 3 days of fun and money. I had to take Henry to the Eye Vet today. This was just a schedule follow up. But, last night something happened to his left eye while I was at work. I thought the glaucoma was back. His eye was shut up and the lid was swollen. I had fears of spending 1300 bucks just to have his operate on again. But, good news. The Eye Vet said both eyes the pressure was very good. He said that his left eye was inflamed but he did not think it was from anything to do with glaucoma. He said he could not rule out a pressure spike but more than likely since Henry is blind in that eye he either hit it or poke it on something. The Eye Vet gave me an anti inflammatory to use for 10 days. He said that no other medicine is needed in the eye because it is dead and the pressure is not a problem anymore. Henry goes back in 4 months, earlier if any problems. I am very glad because it saves me a lot of money.</p>

I went to bed Tuesday night and woke up Wednesday morning and my foot was killing me and it had swollen up. I hurt so bad I was limping Wednesday and Thursday. Thursday I told my supervisor I could not keep walking and limping. So, I came home 5 hours early. I hate to come home from work once there and especially since I was more than half of shift.

However, the little problem so far is not a big problem and the Doctor just thinks it might be a benign problem. I don&rsquo;t want to go into too much detail yet. On the downside, they gave me the wrong prescription. I was supposed to get a subscription for Clarinex and they gave me one for Clarintin.

			 <p>Ok for all those who have inquiring minds&hellip;I did not have a blind date this weekend. My friend and his wife that were going to arrange it were not able to. His wife has been sick and not at work. I was informed Thursday of this fact. So, I have lazed around all weekend. I go back to work tomorrow.</p>

			 <p>Well, the website is updated for Thanksgiving! I hope everyone has a great one. I will not be working on Thanksgiving Eve or Thanksgiving but have to work the day after, the dreaded start of Christmas Shopping season. Henry is doing great in his left eye. However, the Eye Vet on the day I bought him said the pressure was up in the right eye and he has increased the number of medications. I take him back on the 18th, as you can see from my updated my calendar page.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On a different note I am off this weekend and had planned to do a fresh install of my computer. I will put that off for a couple of weeks waiting on some new software to arrive. I might even have a blind date Saturday night, we&rsquo;ll see. I have an odd schedule for Wednesday and Thursday. So Take care everyone and hope everyone is doing great! That is all for now.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW I am catching up on all my shows that I missed while working this weekend. Also, my cable provider, Adelphia, is upping the rates. So, I am looking at alternatives if anyone has suggestions. Brighthouse is out of the question. Way to expensive.</p>

			 <p>Henry had to go to the Eye Vet. He has to have another shot in his left eye. The Vet stated he only had one other case where the shot to the eye did not stop the glaucoma. So I have to take him next week and pay another $200.00 to have the eye injected again. The Vet will just charge for the shot and anaesthesia. No stitches this time for Henry though. That Left Eye has always been a pain.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am off until Friday, going out to dinner with some friends Thursday night to Outback Steakhouse. Take care everyone.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Henry Eye Vet Update<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->:  I took Henry to the Eye Vet yesterday for a check up to make sure the pressure was staying down still. Well, no it was back up in the 40&rsquo;s. So they medicine worked for a while. I have come to the hard conclusion that I am going to have to a procedure done just to his left eye that would basically kill that eye. That way he is in no pain. He will be blind in that eye but will not be in pain and not have to take medicine that is not working. I can tell when the eye bothers him he whines. The other alternative was to try a procedure that saves the eye. However, it is not guarantee to work and stick and it costs $1500 and up depending on how long he has to stay at the Vets. Usually it is 3 days. But, again no guarantee. Also, the Vet is unsure if he has lost any vision and is just see shadows in that eye. They have no way of telling if he has lost vision. The other procedure to kill the eye takes only a few minutes is not that invasive and will take about a couple weeks to kill the eye. Henry would only be on medication to help comfort the eye until it dies. This procedure costs $650 and is guarantee to end the pain. He will still have the right eye and the pressures in that eye have remained low and the right eye did not have complications. The left eye did and has had all bad things happened to it. The right eye was quite healthy when the cataract was removed and the cataract was very small in that eye. So, he will have one good eye. I think I am going have to do the least costly and ultimately the best thing for him. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I saw a completed blind dog at the eye Vet the other day and he got around pretty good. Henry wont be completely blind just in the left eye. I hope he can forgive me for doing this but I think it will be the best for him in the long run. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the work front. I started with a new team and I don&rsquo;t know anybody on it. The same nice enough but would prefer to work with people I know. We will see how it works out. Hopefully, a couple of friends of mine will end up on the same team and this would make it more tolerable. Also, at least on this new team I will have all major holidays off this year like Thanksgiving and Christmas.</p>

			 <p>Hey everyone! So, I have not blogged in a long time. Things are very busy at work now. I am getting close to my on the job training period. I should be finished the first week of September if everything goes well. I have had 4 trainers before the one I have now and they were all excellent. The one I have now is great he is younger than me but knows what he is doing. He will probably be one of my supervisors in the future.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the health front I have to make an appointment. I think I am coming down with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->another<!-- raw HTML omitted --> sinus infection. I don&rsquo;t really think I &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->fully<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; recovered from my last one. Doctors hate giving out antibiotics anymore. I think if they put me on one for 2 months. I would be definitely cured for a while or at least until the next cold. I also need to go back to Doctor Anglin my eye doctor to have my pressure checked. She was a little concerned with it last time and wanted me to have it re-checked in six months. Well, it is six months. So, I guess I will make an appointment with the doctor in the next couple of weeks and get the sinus infection and then see if he will give me a referral to her so I don&rsquo;t have to pay for it.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, this has been a long post. I will be off Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Saturday, I have been invited to a birthday party so I will be out at the birthday party on Saturday.</p>

The only things that will change is my upload speed will drop down to 128 kilobits and I will be switching my long distance carrier from  AT&amp;T to Verizon. But, the long distance is supposed to be unlimited so we will see.</p>

So, I will have to wait for next month to tell how much of a pay cut I took. However, I will be over the amount I was making at my last job by the middle next year. The money I got from leaving my last job has paid off several bills. I wish it could have been more. I would play the Lottery, however, I have just enough money for expenses and bills next month. So, maybe next month sometime I will come up with a little extra money.

I had to go down and fill out another one even though I could not remember all of the original information. They said that did not matter and that unless I wanted my start date to be tomorrow and be considered a temporary worker today I need to redo it. So off to the Personnel Department I went and filled out what I need too. Of course it was not as neat and thorough as my original because I was rushed and unprepared. But, other than that went about the way I expected. Tomorrow is going to be a long day. I have to be at work at 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM. But only a half of day training on Wednesday.</p>

			 <p>I worked a double last night. Have only had 4 hours of sleep. I had to take Henry to the Eye Vet for a follow-up. Some mixed news. His eye is looking good from the surgery and the other eye will be done next week. However, the doctor is keeping him, long term, on medicine for his eye for glaucoma. He is worried he might develop it, if hes not put permanently on the medicine. He says that it must be genetic. Because it is in both eyes. If it was just in his left eye he could attribute the narrowing of his eye duct to scaring. But, since the right eye has not been operated on yet it must be genetic. So to prevent it he is keeping him on the glaucoma medicine. I told Henry he better not go blind. Well, off to the eye doctor myself tomorrow.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Myers-Briggs would say that you are an INTJ (Introvert, Intuitive, Thinker, Judger). In Star Trek language, you share a basic personality configuration with Jean-Luc Picard and Seven of Nine.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->People like you are generally autonomous, aloof, and intellectual. You sometimes give the impression you have no need of others, but you&rsquo;re intensely curious and driven to learn. You&rsquo;re cautious with others socially and respond best to people who don&rsquo;t push you to be friendly or affectionate. You appreciate when others follow your lead and accept your criticism in the helpful spirit in which it is intended. You&rsquo;re calm by nature and feel off-balance when confronted by highly emotional people.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->You&rsquo;re highly organized and expect the same of others. You analyze automatically and enjoy seeing patterns and trends. When your mind is made up, that&rsquo;s it, which means that while you&rsquo;re definitive and strong, you can be stubborn and arrogant.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->You respond best to other people&rsquo;s needs when they tell you about them clearly. You value honesty greatly. You prize people who listen to you and respect your ideals. You are somewhat contemptuous of those who don&rsquo;t pay attention to what you say.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->You&rsquo;re a conservative dresser, but you have a unique and personal style.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your primary goal in life is achieving independence and being able to live according to your own standards. Your reward is continual expansion of your competence and knowledge.

I will be glad when I can discontinue giving him his eye medicine. I have to get up at 2 AM every morning then again at 8 AM to give it to him.

I was supposed to take him on Wednesday the 8th but noticed something wrong with his left eye Friday. He had a gray tint to his left eye. So, I called the Vet and had to take him in this morning. He has a cataract in the left eye. He has an appointment with a Vet who specializes in ophthalmology on Wednesday. This visit is going to cost $95.00 dollars and the surgery if he has to have is very expensive could be as high as $2000.00. I don&rsquo;t know where I am going to get that kind of money.

It did not record my shows tonight Everwood, 7th Heaven and CSI Miami. Luckily, I only missed 15 minutes of CSI Miami. I can catch Everwood on Sunday (I have to record it because I will be working) but 7th Heaven is a wash. This makes me enraged. So, I have put it up on Ebay. Like I said the unit works it just does not like my Cable company and connection for some reason. I hope to sale it. But, in any event I am going to go in the hole in the short term and buy another TIVO.</p>

They took 3 vails of blood and urine. They only call if something is wrong. But, I will probably call them to see how the results were. I liked this Doctor. I got a flu shot and a tetanus shot.

Why is it when you think you are 2 steps ahead it actually turns out to be one step behind?

			 <p>Well, I got the SonicBlue ReplayTV yesterday. So far I have to say TIVO is better. TIVO implements it&rsquo;s system in a more user friendly way. SonicBlue is not a bad company. The ReplayTV does have 3 things I really like. Such as, Ethernet connection to update instead of telephone line, automatically skips commercial when viewing recorded material and can program to record a show from the Internet so don&rsquo;t have to be home. But, if I had to recommend a PVR/DVR to someone I have to say I like the TIVO better.</p>

			 <p>Hello everyone,
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    First of all I have made some bad financial choices in the past couple of weeks. I purchased a real web site (or at least I thought) from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Web Extreme<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it costs me $157.00 dollars and after the first year it would have been $132.00. I had a minor problem at first and this was miss communication. Then I developed a big problem. I could receive e-mail but not send via my e-mail program. I tried to contact technical support and no support. They are supposed to have a 30 day money back guarantee less the $25.00 setup fee. Well, I choose to cancel. I have been trying to get my money back and have the account cancel for a week. I even found a telephone number for the supposed administrator. Well still no luck it seems I am out my money. Lesson learned. I have transfer back my <a href="mailto:Michael@michaelleemitchell.net">Michael@michaelleemitchell.net</a> e-mail address back to Yahoo!. Hopefulley it will be available again in about 4 days. That cost me an additional $10.00. Lesson learned if I do get a real full pledge web site it will be with a big company such as Verizon or Bellsouth. Even if it costs more.

			 <p>Well, unfortunately I start midnights tonight. For the next 28 days my life will come to a busy zombie movie. Work, sleep, eat, doing employment things for a new perspective job and more work. But, I have a good concept that I wish I could market. A PC that is running some operating system (Linux, Windows XP Professional, etc&hellip;) with multiple processors. This would be the house server. Every house would have one. Every thing in the house would have a Ethernet connection. The house server would store all your DVD&rsquo;s and CD&rsquo;s. Your TV Signal would pass through it. Your Internet connection would be tied into it. Your PC could pass on that episode of The Shield or Smallville that it recorded as the DVR to any TV you are watching in any room. While your refrigerator is telling the house server that the ice machine is filling up and someone requests a CD be played in the bathroom while they take a shower. That is the next thing. Of course you would have to have another computer that is hooked up to the house server so that you play games. The house server would also be the answering machine, fax machine and etc&hellip;&hellip; What do you think? Anyone want to give my capital?</p>

			 <p>Sinus infection is subsiding thanks to antibiotics. Well, I am enjoying my 2 days off. Hopefully, this will be a slow week. Sunday, which was my Friday for work, was extremely busy. Went bike riding tonight with my Dad. Went bicycled 2.5 miles.</p>

			 <p>It has been a few days since I posted. I am currently living with another sinus infection. I went to the doctors today and have been put back on antibiotics. I made out like a bandit today. The doctor gave me a lot of samples. This is great since my fund intake is a little low right now. I am almost finished with my new job application for another job I am applying for. I hope to have it in by Wednesday of next week. I start back to work tomorrow but, luckily this week I have no overtime. Well, I hope everyone else is doing fine. I am also hunting for a good book to read. I have ordered the new Left Behind book and hopefully will have it by the end of next week. I also found a place to buy my VHS tapes. I will hopefully ship them off next week.</p>

I also found a good website <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Spun.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> . It is a place you can sell DVD, CD or games that you don&rsquo;t want. I bought The Beach a couple of years ago. I traded it in for Galaxy Quest and only paid $9.00 with shipping and return shipping for The Beach.</p>

Take care everyone and will try to turn on Webcam next Monday and Tuesday as well as update the log. By the way I found a good show I started watching.

Artificial Intelligence. So far we watched (we being my mom, dad and me) Vanilla Sky and Corky Romano. Vanilla Sky stunk. Corky Romano was great. I laughed so hard I almost passed out. I think I will have to buy Corky Romano. Well, let you know on the rest. As you can see on the Webcam page it has been updated. If you were watching that page most of the day, you found out the camera was turned on almost all day.</p>

			 <p>To catch everyone up to date. I saw Spiderman last week. This movie is awesome. I can&rsquo;t wait to get it on DVD. Lately, TV has been good. I saw Spiderman then watch a miniseries called Dinotopia. That was excellent too. Also, my favorite TV Shows are airing there Season Finales. Unfortunately, after next week reruns start and nothing will be on. I did miss the District on Saturday night. If anyone has it on Videotape send it please. I am going to see Star Wars Attack of the Clones this month. I also discovered the highs and lows of selling on eBay. Sold one thing did not sell the other. Well, hope to update the webcam page with new live pictures tomorrow. Hope to update the whole site the end of the month. Hope everyone is well. Take care for now.</p>

			 <p>Another weekend is here. I look forward to it for the time off. However, TV stinks on the weekend. In fact, it stinks from Thursday nights till Monday nights. My viewing is featured pack on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. I start of with 7th Heaven on Monday followed by Third Watch. On Tuesday it is Smallville and Gilmore Girls. Wednesday&rsquo;s it is Enterprise and then Dawson&rsquo;s Creek. Though I have to admit I am getting tired of Dawson&rsquo;s Creek. That is for the week. Besides me watching Call for Help and The Screen Savers on TechTV. In between it is CNBC. I wished they were to make a couple of Star Trek&rsquo;s. It was great having Star Trek Voyager then Deep Space Nine. Why are the making TV so boring lately? Especially on the weekends. There are no more good shows, other than the aforementioned ones. I find myself buying more and more DVD&rsquo;s. I put a file on the Favorite Links page. It is a true type font of my very own handwriting (print not cursive).</p>

			 <p>Today was a good day a work. However, when I got home it was not good. It started out good but turned horrible. I had to take my Mom and Dad&rsquo;s dog Camelot to the pound. He had cancer. He was starting to suffer. He was not eating, drinking or using the bathroom. I had to take him so they could euthanized him today. That was very hard to do. I rarely cry but I did today. He was a good dog. He never fussed about anything. Henry my dog is like a child to me. I feel for Henry the same way I feel for my niece Alexus. I felt like Camelot was one of family. Dogs can make people cry and laugh. Most people just think of them as animals. But, for some, like me, they are kid replacements.</p>

It will probably take me another month or two to see have everything installed. I am also weeding out what is and what is not compatible with Windows XP.

			 <p>Finally have my computer upgraded to the Final Version of Windows XP Pro. I have reinstalled all my essential software. However, in wiping the hard drive I lost all of my save photos. I forgot after the 4th time doing a clean install to figure out two pieces of hardware that did not want to work to backup my graphics folder.

So using my caller ID I called the number and got some very rude lady. I explained what was happening and she said what do you want me to do there must be over a 1000 people working here. I said I want it to stop this is getting ridculious. I said someone has the wrong number punched in. She kept giving me a hard time. I told her let me speak to a supervisor. I got a more cooperative person and she apologized and said she would see what see could do. As soon as I hung up with her it happened again. It did it one more time and then it stopped.</p>
