				"content_text": "<p>I’ve always wanted a telescope. Something I could use to take photos and videos of the night sky with my phone or camera. I recently came across a YouTube video about the Zwo Seestar S50, but since this is my first telescope, I decided to start with the more beginner-friendly <strong>S30</strong> and bought it for my birthday.</p>\n<p>I’ve owned it for a couple of months, but only recently started using it seriously. Here are some of the first photos I captured with it on <strong>July 4, 2025</strong>:</p>\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/seestars3007042025.jpg\" width=\"600\"  alt=\"Auto-generated description: A detailed photograph of the moon shows its craters and surface features against a black sky.\"><br><br>\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/seestars30070420251.jpg\" width=\"600\"  alt=\"Auto-generated description: A detailed view of the moon's surface, highlighting its craters and dark patches.\">\n<!--more-->\n<p>These images were taken right from my front yard — I still can’t believe the clarity. Here’s one I took with my phone (Galaxy S24 Ultra, no zoom) while I was setting up the Seestar:</p>\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/moonfromphnes24ultranonzoom07042005.jpg\" width=\"600\"  alt=\"Auto-generated description: A nighttime sky is partially covered with clouds and silhouettes of trees, with a bright moon visible in the center.\">\n<p>Later that evening, we heard fireworks going off in the distance. While the moon was the star of the night, I also caught this fun fireworks shot from our front yard. We were hearing more fireworks from our neighbors all around us than we were actually seeing.</p>\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/fireworksathome07042025.jpg\" width=\"600\"  alt=\"Auto-generated description: A warmly lit house is surrounded by trees and shrubs under a night sky.\">\n<p>I’m planning to set up a dedicated page in the future as I learn more about using the <strong>Seestar S30</strong>. I hope you enjoyed these photos as much as I enjoyed experimenting with the telescope. It’s truly amazing how it filters out light and zooms in on the moon with such detail.</p>\n<p><code>#astronomy</code> <code>#telescopes</code> <code>#moon</code> <code>#personal</code></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img alt=\" A cinematic oil painting of a 1776 Independence Day parade in a colonial village. Continental soldiers in blue and red march down a dusty road, led by a large Betsy Ross flag. Civilians on both sides cheer and wave flags, with women and children in period clothing celebrating. The warm tones and painterly texture give the scene a nostalgic, historic feel.\" src=\"https://mitchelltribe.com/uploads/2025/627dcd631d.png\"/></p>\n<p>Today, we celebrate the 249th birthday of the United States — my home country and my birth nation. Nearly two and a half centuries have passed since our founding, and in that time, we’ve experienced triumphs and trials, unity and division, progress and setbacks.</p>\n<p>Some might say we’re not in a good place right now. And yes, it’s true — we are in a turbulent chapter. But I take comfort in history. Nations go through cycles. England, France, and the rest of Europe have weathered centuries of political and social upheaval. They have survived monarchies, revolutions, world wars, and more — and they endure. So will we.</p>\n<p>Europe was home to many of history’s greatest empires: the Greeks, the Romans, and the vast British Empire — the largest the world has ever known. In modern times, however, the American nation was instrumental in bringing an end to both World Wars. That matters. We have never been perfect, but we have often stood firm in moments when history demanded courage, sacrifice, and leadership.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Still, our own democracy is not immune to decay. As a Christian, I believe this world is temporary and that we are called to live with both faith and responsibility. Jesus told us to “render to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” That means engaging with the political world around us, even when it feels broken.</p>\n<p>We are more politically divided than we have been in decades, but division is not the end. It is part of the cycle — one we have seen before. Perhaps now is the time to finally confront the flaws in our representative democracy, flaws that both major parties have exploited for years. If we do not face them, we risk drifting toward an oligarchy that could look far too much like modern-day Russia. But if we act, reform, and renew, there is still time to strengthen what we have.</p>\n<p>Let's end on an upbeat note:</p>\n<p>Happy Birthday, America.</p>\n<p>We chose freedom over kings and democracy over dictatorship. We have faced down empires before and prevailed. Here’s to many more years ahead, and to a hopeful, united celebration for our 250th year.</p>\n",

I’ve had several\nideas. The reason I’m blogging about this is because I’ve been trying to\nfigure out what should be a blog post. I tend to think posts should be\nmedium to long in nature. But people aren’t reading my stuff anyway, and\nhonestly, do I really care?</p>\n\n<p>I’m blogging for myself, just to get my thoughts down and out of my\nhead.</p>\n\n<p>I use <strong>Sharkey</strong> and <strong>Micro.blog</strong> for what\nI call short-burst posts and reactions to things happening in the\nmoment. Kind of like I did back in the pre-Musk Twitter days.</p>\n\n<p>Back in February, I blogged about whether anybody even reads my posts.\nIn the weeks and months that followed, I saw other people wondering the\nsame thing. I found that kind of amusing, since I had just written about\nit and was thinking the exact same thing.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>I have four blogs, all focused on personal ideas, thoughts, life\nhappenings, and really just about anything. You might ask, “Why so\nmany?” Well, when I started thinking about moving away from WordPress, I\nwent back to my old <strong>Google Blogspot/Blogger</strong> blog. Then\nI started doing some serious searching and research.</p>\n\n<p>I first settled on <strong>Write.as</strong> and even bought a separate\ndomain for it. But it felt a bit dated and disjointed.</p>\n\n<p>Then I found <strong>Micro.blog</strong> through several sources, and I\nliked it a lot. After joining, I appreciated the community, the\ntechnologist who runs it, and the overall concept and service. However,\nI had already paid for five years of Write.as service, plus the original\nyear, because they had a sale that was too good to pass up. At the time,\nI hadn’t fully decided if Micro.blog was the right one for me.</p>\n\n<p>Later, Micro.blog introduced me to <strong>Scribbles</strong>, and I\nreally fell in love with its WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) web\neditor. I think it's best in class. It was missing some things that\nMicro.blog offers, but Scribbles was a one-time purchase, so I bought\nit.</p>\n\n<p>Like Write.as and Micro.blog, Scribbles is run by real people, not a big\ncorporation. Vincent Ritter, the creator and owner of Scribbles.page, is\ndoing great work on the platform, and it looks sharp. He also works with\nManton Reece on Micro.blog, which makes the connection even more\ninteresting. I much prefer one-time purchases over subscriptions, and\nScribbles offered that.</p>\n\n<p>Then AI entered the picture, and I ended up really liking\n<strong>ChatGPT</strong>, even though I had some hesitation. I’m still\nnot sure Sam Altman is someone I trust, but the product itself is\nexcellent and works well.</p>\n\n<p>I tried other tools too. The only one I liked besides ChatGPT was\n<strong>Claude AI</strong>, which uses a yearly subscription. If I have\nto subscribe to something, I prefer a yearly plan. Claude isn’t as\nfull-featured as ChatGPT, but it seems to help more with troubleshooting\ncode. I’m not a software developer, but for a beginner like me working\nwith Python, Claude makes things just a bit clearer.</p>\n\n<p>I also tried <strong>Google Gemini</strong>, and at least on the free\nplan, it’s frustrating. It often refuses to answer even mildly\ncontroversial or nuanced questions with that robotic “I’m still learning\nabout this” message. It doesn’t feel useful or confident. I haven’t\ntried the paid plan, and honestly, the free version didn’t convince me\nthat the paid one would be any better.</p>\n\n<p>Claude’s paid plan is helpful, but even that runs into usage caps more\noften than I’d like. ChatGPT, on the other hand, gives me consistent\nresults and generous access for getting real work done.</p>\n\n<p>At some point, I stepped back and realized just how many services I’ve\npaid for. Between the blogging platforms like\n<strong>Micro.blog</strong>, <strong>Write.as</strong>,\n<strong>Scribbles.page</strong>, and <strong>Blogger</strong>, and the\nAI tools like <strong>ChatGPT</strong> and <strong>Claude</strong>, I’ve\ninvested in quite a few things to support my writing and publishing.</p>\n\n<p>So I told myself: I’m going to actually use all of them. I paid for\nthem, I like them, and I want to get my money’s worth out of each one.</p>\n\n<p>With help from ChatGPT, and sometimes Claude, I started mapping out how\nto connect it all. What I’m still missing is a central place to write\nand publish directly from my Windows desktop. Each blogging platform has\nits own quirks, so I’ve been working toward something that brings them\ninto a more unified process.</p>\n\n<p>I bought <strong>Typora</strong>, and I really like it, but it only\nworks smoothly with Write.as. I’m testing other word processors that\nsupport RTF for Scribbles. For Blogger and Micro.blog, I’m still\nexploring options. I don’t usually post directly on Blogger; I use it\nmore as a backup archive for Micro.blog.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, <strong>Micro.blog</strong> is my main blog. I’ve probably\nsaid that many times before. I either use the web editor or\n<strong>Lillihub</strong>, which is a Micropub poster created by Loura\nat <a href=\"https://heyloura.com\">heyloura.com</a>. She did a great job\nwith it.  I’ve really come to enjoy using it, and if there ever were a\nWindows desktop version, I’d be first in line. That’s how impressed I am\nwith the tool. </p>\n\n<p>So, I started by asking what to blog about and ended up answering it by\nwriting this. I guess that’s how blogging works sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you’re figuring out your own setup or just curious about mine,\nthanks for tagging along.</p>\n\n<p>#blogging #digitalgarden #microblogging</p>\n",

This will\nprobably be a long one—and it might even turn into a series of posts\naround a central theme.<br />My mother—more than me, but me too—has\nalways wondered about her mother’s family.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>A Childhood Cut Short</strong></p>\n\n<p>My grandmother was born in Poland in 1926, before World War II. She was\njust 13, almost 14, when Germany invaded. According to my mother, my\ngrandmother was at school in Kraków when the invasion happened. She was\ntaken away from her parents, older brother, and sister. The last time\nshe ever saw them was before going to school that day.</p>\n\n<p>I just learned this part while preparing for this post: my grandmother\nwas taken to a concentration camp and was “in line for a shower.” She\nwas seen by a German officer, who pulled her out of the line. She was\nforced to serve as an au pair—but in truth, she was a slave.</p>\n\n<p>My mother told me that, surprisingly, my grandmother was treated well by\nthe German and his family and was almost certainly saved from death by\nthat officer. My grandmother never knew why she was chosen out of\neveryone in line.</p>\n\n<p>We all know what “going into the showers” meant. But I don’t think it\nwas just fate that saved her—I believe it was divine intervention. If\nnot for that moment, how would my mother be here today—and, by\nextension, my brother, sister, and me?<br /><strong>God has a plan for\nall of us, and He always makes sure His plans are carried out.</strong></p>\n<!--more-->\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>A Family Lost</strong></p>\n\n<p>She never reunited with her parents or siblings. That part of her life\nremains a mystery to this day.</p>\n\n<p>Were they killed? Did they survive? Did my great-uncle or great-aunt\nhave children? Do I have cousins in Poland—in Kraków or somewhere\nelse—even today?</p>\n\n<p>I just don’t know.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>An American Love Story</strong></p>\n\n<p>I know she met my maternal grandfather during the war—he was an American\nsoldier—and supposedly fell in love with him. That’s how she came to\nAmerica.</p>\n\n<p>And so, by extension, I know almost nothing about that side of my\nfamily. It starts and stops with her. Poland is still high on my bucket\nlist to visit—maybe someday I’ll find out more. But for now, it remains\na blank page.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>A Marriage Rediscovered</strong></p>\n\n<p>I couldn’t even tell you what town my grandmother came from in Poland.\nMy mother told me that my grandparents were married three times: twice\nin Germany and once in the United States. First, they were married by an\nArmy chaplain. Then they had a church wedding. Finally, they married\nagain in the U.S.—probably in West Virginia.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview flex-col justify-center attachment--jpg\">\n      <img class=\"lightbox__image strip-metadata lightbox__image\" srcset=\"https://scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBem80QVE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--38aaf4a447cb9205ead9f3e06f958fdea63fa31d/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUVHa0NBQXc2Q25OaGRtVnlld2M2Q25OMGNtbHdWRG9NY1hWaGJHbDBlV2xrIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJ2YXJpYXRpb24ifX0=--95bb9764b8481bddaaffec4af57d9e494bae5163/Grandma%20Kinser%20in%20her%20wedding%20dress.jpg 2x\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A young woman in a 1940s-style white wedding dress and veil, smiling warmly while holding a large bouquet of white flowers.

This one’s on Peacock, and since I’m canceling the service in July, I’ve got to finish it before then.</p>\n<p>That said—this show is <em>really</em> good. I’ve watched the first three episodes, and I have to say: the English seriously know how to make television.

The casting is spot-on, and while I know not every detail is historically or biblically precise, the spirit and themes are respectfully portrayed. The creators, actors, and entire team are doing an outstanding job, and this is currently my favorite show. I’m glad they’re aiming for seven seasons—I’m especially curious how they’ll depict their take on Revelations. 🎬</p>\n<p><code>#TV</code> <code>#Entertainment</code> <code>#Peacock</code> <code>#PrimeVideo</code></p>\n",

Let me restate\nsomething I’ve said before: I’m not a software developer. But I do have\nideas—and I’ve always wished I could bring them to life. Well, thanks to\nAI, that’s starting to happen.</p>\n\n<p>I recently started a <a href=\"https://mitchelltribe.rodeo\">Sharkey</a>\ninstance for myself. Honestly, I like it better than Mastodon. But I’m\nnot quite ready to give Mastodon up entirely, and I wanted my blog posts\nto automatically be shared on Sharkey. When I post to my blog on\nMicro.blog, it uses <strong>POSSE</strong> (Publish On your Own Site,\nSyndicate Elsewhere)—but Sharkey isn’t included in that.</p>\n\n<p>So AI helped me fix that with <a href=\"https://n8n.io\">n8n</a>. I set up\nseveral workflows so that when I post to my website, the RSS feed is\nmonitored by n8n using the workflow shown below. It took a bit of\neffort—and the help of <strong>two AIs</strong>.<br /></p>\n\n<figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview flex-col justify-center attachment--png\">\n      <img class=\"lightbox__image strip-metadata lightbox__image\" srcset=\"https://scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMm8zQVE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--46ca3a86e9985c155373b2ea9a420bde219c18c1/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUVHa0NBQXc2Q25OaGRtVnlld2M2Q25OMGNtbHdWRG9NY1hWaGJHbDBlV2xrIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJ2YXJpYXRpb24ifX0=--a18847b6c1cccf2736612f487841b9c550593dc1/microblog%20to%20sharkey%20n8n%20image.png 2x\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"n8n workflow for posting from Micro.blog to Sharkey, showing a schedule trigger, HTTP request, formatting code, and final post to Sharkey.\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/microblog20to20sharkey20n8n20image.png\" decoding=\"async\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"attachment__caption text-center\">\n      Micro.blog to Shareky n8n work flow.\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p><br />Funny thing: I subscribe to both Claude AI and ChatGPT, and I\noften pit them against each other as a sanity check. Since I can’t\nverify the code myself with confidence, I compare their answers. And\nwhen they disagree, I paste both responses into\n<strong>Perplexity</strong> or <strong>Google’s Gemini</strong> to get a\nbroader consensus on the best solution.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, Claude got me about 98% of the way there—but I ran into a\nformatting issue. So I dropped the whole thing into ChatGPT, and it\nimmediately identified the problem, fixed it, and now my Sharkey posts\nlook just like they came from Micro.blog.</p>\n\n<p>Now I have a similar workflow for this Scribbles site:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>One less node.\n\n</li>\n<li>Atom feed instead of JSON.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview flex-col justify-center attachment--png\">\n      <img class=\"lightbox__image strip-metadata lightbox__image\" srcset=\"https://scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBMnMzQVE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--33c10a505c044e4b12828b2e1ad5f9c9a8995fe1/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUVHa0NBQXc2Q25OaGRtVnlld2M2Q25OMGNtbHdWRG9NY1hWaGJHbDBlV2xrIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJ2YXJpYXRpb24ifX0=--a18847b6c1cccf2736612f487841b9c550593dc1/scribbles%20to%20sharkey%20n8n%20image.png 2x\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"n8n workflow for posting from Scribbles to Sharkey, using an RSS feed trigger with code and formatting steps before sending to Sharkey.\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/scribbles20to20sharkey20n8n20image.png\" decoding=\"async\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"attachment__caption text-center\">\n      Scribbles to Sharkey n8n workflow.\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p><br />Without AI, it would’ve taken me a <strong>year</strong> to figure\nthis out on my own. Honestly, if it weren’t for AI, I probably never\nwould’ve discovered Micro.blog, Scribbles, or anything else—I’d still be\nstuck on WordPress, struggling to figure it out (which, for some reason,\nnever clicked with me, even after nearly a decade of trying).</p>\n\n<p>AI has been like a private tutor for me. I had always wanted to\nself-host using a Raspberry Pi, but never managed to start—until now. AI\nis truly making life better for me.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, I see the gloom-and-doom predictions about jobs being replaced by\nAI. But that’s not what this post is about. I just wanted to share how\nI’ve <strong>enhanced POSSE for my site</strong> with the help of AI.</p>\n\n<p><br />👉 Follow me on Sharkey: michael@mitchelltribe.rodeo</p>\n\n<p><br />#n8n #POSSE #Sharkey #SelfHosting </p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n",

I relaxed and played one of my favorite PC games. I also spent some time troubleshooting my Python weather bot — a little project I built just to post local weather updates from my house. But this post isn’t really about that.</p>\n<p>While relaxing, I ended up watching and reading about a few things: the <strong>No Kings</strong> protests, the <strong>U.S. Army's 250th birthday parade</strong>, and — from across the pond — the <strong>Trooping the Colour</strong> (yes, with the British spelling).</p><p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Watching the coverage of both the American and British military events, a few things struck me as uniquely <em>American</em>. In the U.S., the military plays a big role in society, but it's different from the role it plays in the United Kingdom. Ever since the Vietnam War and the disgraceful way many service members were treated afterward, American attitudes toward the military have shifted. That change became even more pronounced after <strong>September 11, 2001</strong>, when respect for the armed forces surged — and that respect largely continues today.</p>\n<p>That said, I worry that under the current administration, the military is being redefined more as a domestic police force than a national defense institution. If that perception continues, the hard-earned respect for the military might erode. I hope I’m wrong.</p>\n<p>In American culture, we formally honor military service during <strong>Memorial Day</strong> and <strong>Veterans Day</strong>, with a somewhat quieter <strong>Military Appreciation Month</strong> in May. While we also celebrate <strong>Independence Day</strong> on July 4th, it’s more about our nation’s founding and freedom from monarchy than a military holiday per se.</p>\n<p>I’ve never been to the United Kingdom, so some of this may be off — I’m basing it on what I’ve seen on YouTube and what I learned in history classes. But the impression I get is this: in the U.K., the military isn’t just honored — it’s <em>woven</em> into the national identity. Unlike the U.S., which celebrates national holidays like Thanksgiving, Labor Day, or Independence Day, the U.K. seems to celebrate through ceremonies and events tied to military history, royal anniversaries, and traditional pageantry — like <strong>Trooping the Colour</strong>, <strong>Remembrance Day</strong>, and the <strong>changing of the guard</strong>. Their military parades, steeped in tradition, make ours look minimal by comparison.</p>\n<p>In the U.K., the armed forces swear allegiance not to a constitution but to <strong>the King</strong> — currently <strong>King Charles III</strong>. That’s a key difference. In the U.S., service members swear an oath to <strong>uphold the Constitution</strong> and follow the lawful orders of the President as Commander-in-Chief. That constitutional foundation — not loyalty to a person — is what sets the U.S. military apart. Sadly, I think some of that foundational principle is being lost today, both by military leadership and elected officials, as political polarization increases.</p>\n<p>I find it fascinating that the U.K. doesn’t have national holidays like a “<strong>Magna Carta Day</strong>.” After all, the Magna Carta is one of the most seminal documents in world history — the first to formally limit the power of a king, a figure once considered almost god-like. You’d think that would be a major holiday. Nor do they have anything quite like <strong>Thanksgiving</strong> or <strong>Labor Day</strong> to honor gratitude or the contributions of working people. Instead, from what I’ve seen, many of their national events center around military achievements, royal ceremonies, and traditions rooted in conquest and empire.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, a lot of the world’s current instability — particularly in the Middle East and parts of Asia — can be traced back to the way the British Empire collapsed. Rather than transitioning peacefully into independent and self-governed nations, many former colonies were left in a state of disarray, with poorly drawn borders, unresolved conflicts, and power vacuums that fueled decades of unrest. The end of the empire wasn’t so much a graceful handoff as it was an uncontrolled unraveling — and we’re still seeing the consequences today.</p>\n<p>I suppose that’s fitting. The United Kingdom was once the most powerful and expansive global empire the world has ever known. While America isn’t a global empire in the traditional colonial sense, it has certainly played a role in <em>ending</em> empires — which feels right, given the <strong>Independence Day</strong> we’ll celebrate in a few weeks, marking 249 years since our break from monarchy.</p>\n<p>My final thought: if there's one thing we could take a cue from, it's how the British approach military celebrations, parades, and pageantry. They do it with precision, pride, and a deep sense of tradition. There’s something to admire in that — and maybe it’s time the United States took a few lessons in how to put on a proper military parade.</p>\n<p><a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:NationalIdentity\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">NationalIdentity</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:CivicReflection\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">CivicReflection</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:WeekendThoughts\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">WeekendThoughts</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:Commentary\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">Commentary</span></a></p>\n",

Colorful alien landscape featuring a red and pink grass field, exotic plants, and various alien creatures including dinosaurs and flying animals. A humanoid figure stands near a spacecraft while several rockets and ships ascend into the sky. A large geometric monolith floats in the sky with a glowing center, and a giant ringed planet is visible in the background\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/swsvppr4.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>I saw that No Man’s Sky has released another update. I’ve been with this game since day one—I preordered it and even got the free bonus ship, which I still have to this day. That’s one ship I’ll never give up because it was a launch bonus. I’ve upgraded its storage and technology over the years, and it’s still with me.</p>\n<p>I remember launch day—August 12, 2016—very clearly. My first thought was: “This is interesting... but broken.” It wasn’t like what they showed on stage. The experience was pretty basic, and I felt cheated. But I saw that they acknowledged the game’s shortcomings and promised to make things right.</p><p><!--more--></p>\n<p>And they did. They went even further and committed to free DLC. True to the word of Hello Games and Sean Murray, every single update has been free, and they’ve added an incredible amount of value.</p>\n<p>I don’t play as often as I used to. Back then, I’d spend whole weekends exploring. Now I jump back in every few months, and I still play only my first saved game. And that’s okay. No Man’s Sky is kind of like space Minecraft—there’s no real “end.” It’s what you make of it. Technically, the end is reaching the center of the universe... but then you just start over in another one.</p>\n<p>I love jumping from world to world and exploring. Honestly, I probably haven’t done even 50% of what this game offers—but I’m glad it’s all there waiting. This is one of the few games I paid $60 for that has truly been worth it. Next year marks 10 years, and I hope Hello Games does something big—really big—to celebrate.</p>\n<p>Think about it: I spent $6 a year on a game that has delivered about 98% of what was originally promised and continues to grow and stay relevant. I wish more studios would take that approach—release complete games, not betas or glorified alphas, and if things go wrong, fix them. Take as long as it takes, just like Hello Games did.</p>\n<p>The only other studio that’s tried something similar is Rare with <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, though in my opinion, they haven’t gone nearly as far. I haven’t spent another dime on that game. It feels more like a service model now, likely due to Microsoft needing to justify its existence.</p>\n<p>Another game that comes to mind is <em>Starfield</em> from Bethesda. That launch was even worse—it burned me so badly that I stopped buying games on day one or even in the first month. <em>Starfield</em> has gotten more playable now, but it still hasn’t lived up to its hype. Bethesda would do well to follow Hello Games’ example with that title.</p>\n<p>To Hello Games and Sean Murray: I wish you the best of luck in your future projects. I’d gladly buy another game from you—maybe just not on day one or preorder—but you’ve earned my trust again. Please keep evolving <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. Let’s celebrate a fantastic 10 years next year.</p>\n<p>And when you finally decide to stop development, I hope you’ll make it possible to run and maintain the full game offline on our own computers. That would be a perfect sendoff. A true “we’re sorry for the rough launch, and here’s our thank you for sticking with us.”</p>\n<p>You have my trust—and my thanks—as both a gamer and a customer.</p>\n<p><a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:NoMansSky\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">NoMansSky</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:Gaming\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">Gaming</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:HelloGames\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">HelloGames</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:GameDevelopment\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">GameDevelopment</span></a></p>\n",

Then came\nthe relay setup, which took up the rest of the day.</p>\n\n<p>After some trial and error, I got it running on my setup. I even had to\ncompile a version myself to work with my environment—something I’ve\nnever done before. Definitely a first for me.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it’s up and running. ✅</p>\n\n<p>The last piece I’m working through is understanding why Amethyst for\nAndroid shows everything as verified and functioning, while Snort.social\nand Iris.to don’t reflect that. Also, my private relay doesn’t appear\nonline on those platforms yet, so I still have a bit of troubleshooting\nahead.</p>\n\n<p>The Nostr network shows promise—it reminds me of Bluesky and the early\ndays of Twitter.

I’ve had that\nBlogger account for over 20 years, and since it’s free and supports\ncustom domains, I figured — why not use it for archival purposes?</p>\n\n<p>I used to rely on IFTTT to automate this. When I posted something on my\nmain blog, it would trigger a webhook that sent the post to Blogger via\nIFTTT. It worked — most of the time. But lately, IFTTT has become\nunreliable. Since they use a shared API for Blogger across all users,\neven my modest 3 or 4 posts a day would sometimes fail to go through due\nto quota limits.</p>\n\n<p>So, I decided to take control.</p>\n\n<p>I set up a self-hosted automation workflow on my Raspberry Pi to do\nexactly what IFTTT used to do — but using my own system. It works like a\ncharm.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the twist: in Google’s eyes, to make this work, I had to create\nan “app” — just to post to my own blog. That was fine, except that in\n&quot;testing&quot; mode, Google only issues OAuth tokens that last 7 days. After\nthat, you have to manually reconnect. And of course, this always seemed\nto expire at the worst possible time.</p>\n\n<p>With the help of my AI assistant ChatGPT, I figured out how to take the\nfinal step: officially publish my private app to Google’s OAuth system.\nThat removed the 7-day token limit and made my automation stable and\nreliable — just like it should have been in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, this whole process made me realize just how neglected Blogger\nhas become. It’s still a solid platform at its core — fast, stable, and\nwith Google-grade infrastructure behind it — but it hasn’t kept up with\nthe times. OAuth token lifespans, API limitations, lack of automation\nfeatures — all of it could be improved with just a little attention.\nBlogger doesn’t need a full redesign. It just needs a few thoughtful\nupdates to keep it usable in the modern era. Google, if you’re\nlistening: please give Blogger some love.</p>\n\n<p>#Blogger #Automation #SelfHosting #GoogleAPI</p>\n",

The characters were strong and interesting, and the actors and actresses who portrayed them were compelling and talented. The problem was the story.</p>\n<p>While the season did provide some valuable background, explaining how we got to this point, the pacing felt uneven. Some parts were rushed, while others were overly drawn out. It seemed like they were trying to cram the content of four or five additional episodes into just three.</p>\n<p>If you're going to do that, then each episode needs to be treated like a classic TV miniseries—back in the day, miniseries would run across three or four nights, and each episode would be about 90 to 105 minutes (to account for commercial breaks). That kind of format could have helped here.</p>\n<p>Yes, <em>technically</em> (not a spoiler), the show leads into the beginning of <em><strong>Rogue One</strong></em>, but it didn’t tie things up in a satisfying way. <em><strong>Rogue One</strong></em> ends with a powerful, climactic bow. <em>Andor</em>, by contrast, left me disappointed and wanting more.</p>\n<p>After over two years of waiting, we got about 8.5 hours of content total. For that amount of production time, it deserved either more episodes or longer, richer installments. I understand that the time spent producing, directing, and editing was probably five or six times that—but still, for two years of work, you better deliver great pacing, superior storytelling, and fantastic special effects.</p>\n<p>This felt like it had so much potential and tried to hit the right spots, but it was more like scratching the surface and hoping you’d hit the itch. 🎬</p>\n<p><a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:TV\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">TV</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:Entertainment\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">Entertainment</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:Disney\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">Disney</span></a>+</p>\n",

Knowing it’s based on real events made it even more gripping. I can confidently say I’d never want to work in the North Sea—especially not above or below it. If you’re claustrophobic, it could be triggering. Overall, a solid and well-made film that’s definitely worth a watch.</p>\n",

I remember it being 4.00% at the end of last year, and even a bit higher when I opened the account earlier in the year.</p>\n<p>So, let’s recap:</p>\n<ul><li>Credit card interest rates are up</li>\n<li>My pay is stagnating</li>\n<li>My retirement funds are losing money</li>\n<li>And now, my savings rate is steadily declining</li></ul>\n<p>All this while “he who must not be named” <em>shot the whole economy in the foot</em> with what amounts to the largest tax increase in American history, all while claiming <em>“the other country pays the tariff.”</em></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>From what I’ve seen — and this is just my read on the situation — it looks like savings rates are falling for a few reasons: the Federal Reserve may lower the benchmark rate, competition among banks for new deposits is cooling, and fewer people are borrowing or opening new credit lines. That last one I can see firsthand — I've cut almost all discretionary spending. Over the next few months, I plan to cut even more and accelerate debt payments, driven by high interest rates and the looming fear my employer will cut jobs later this year. If they do, I hope I'm not among those affected.</p>\n<p>These two articles back up what I’ve been thinking:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bestmoney.com/online-banking/learn-more/savings-rate-forecast\">BestMoney: Savings Rate Forecast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/banking/savings-rate-forecast\">Business Insider: Banking Forecast</a></li></ul>\n<p>I can really feel all this “winning” — for the other side, whoever they may be.</p>\n<p>If we “win” much more, I’ll be completely broke. And hearing a U.S. President say something like:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.”</em>\n— Donald Trump, <em>Meet the Press</em>, May 2025</p></blockquote><p>\n<p>is beyond belief. If any other President — Democrat or Republican — had said that, we’d see congressional hearings around the clock, possibly even impeachment proceedings.</p>\n<p>Even Senator Rand Paul, who leans more Libertarian than Republican, opposed Trump’s tariffs — which, let’s be honest, were just taxes by another name.</p>\n<p>At what point will both parties say “enough” to this madness? We do need reforms in this country — real reforms, fundamental changes — but it’s a lie that <em>everything in government is broken</em>. Even Elon Musk’s side project Doge-fueled “President Dunce” act couldn’t find $500 billion, let alone $2 trillion, in so-called government waste.</p>\n<p>Now “he who must not be named” is talking about using impoundment — even if Congress passes a budget — just to do what he wants. At what point will Congress, especially Republicans, say: <em>“We control the purse strings. You will spend the money the way we tell you to — or we’ll remove you.”</em></p>\n<p>Republicans are so worried about the next election — but without independents like me, they may have already lost it.</p>\n<p>Tags: <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:Savings\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">Savings</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:Tariffs\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">Tariffs</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:PersonalFinance\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">PersonalFinance</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:USPolitics\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">USPolitics</span></a></p>\n",

I like Firefox, though I do miss some functionality from Chrome—like the ability to cast directly to the TV. Still, one of the things I’ve always appreciated was Pocket.</p>\n<p>I actually signed up for Pocket back when it was called Read It Later, even before Mozilla acquired it. I never paid for the service—I stuck with the free plan. But recently, I decided that Pocket is one service I’m willing to support financially, especially to help Mozilla. I also subscribe to Mozilla’s Relay service (which I’ve started using quite a bit) and pay for it annually.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Overall, I’ve been happy with Pocket. I even started using it with my Kobo e-reader once that integration became available. But lately, things have started to turn.</p>\n<p>I’ve noticed that Pocket hasn’t really improved much, particularly when it comes to reading articles on the desktop—outside of the browser experience, which is just okay. Meanwhile, I’m beginning to feel subscription fatigue and have been exploring some free and open-source alternatives like Wallabag. I’ve also considered using Micro.blog’s built-in bookmark feature, since I already have a Premium subscription there.</p>\n<p>Again, subscription fatigue is real.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, trying to move your Pocket data elsewhere isn’t easy. Pocket’s export method is awkward and basic, making it hard to transfer your saved articles cleanly to another service. That’s been a big frustration and has made me even more inclined to leave Pocket. But I also feel stuck, since I’ve built up a huge archive of saved articles over the years.</p>\n<p>I think once my current Pocket subscription renews this month, that’ll be the last time. Mozilla has been making some puzzling decisions lately—at a time when they really need to retain users. You’d think they would be more customer-friendly to help grow their base.</p>\n<p>Honestly, if Mozilla offered a $15/year subscription that bundled Firefox with some of their other services and prioritized privacy, I think they could really thrive. But they need to embrace that vision fully.</p>\n<p><em>Tags: <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:Pocket\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">Pocket</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:Mozilla\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">Mozilla</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:SubscriptionFatigue\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">SubscriptionFatigue</span></a></em></p>\n",

Well, I’ve tried things I never would\nhave attempted before. For example, I was never quite sure what\nPowerShell was or how to use it. Now, I just describe what I want to do,\nand the AI generates the scripts or code for me.

Untie it and bring it here.”<br />(Luke 19:31) “If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say this: ‘The Lord has need of it.’”<br />(Luke 19:32) So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them.<br />(Luke 19:33) And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”<br />(Luke 19:34) And they said, “The Lord has need of it.”<br />(Luke 19:35) And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it.<br />(Luke 19:36) And as he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road.<br />(Luke 19:37) As he was drawing near—already on the way down the Mount of Olives—the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen,<br />(Luke 19:38) saying, “Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”<br />(Luke 19:39) And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”<br />(Luke 19:40) He answered, “I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.”<br />(Luke 19:41) And when he drew near and saw the city, he wept over it,<br />(Luke 19:42) saying, “Would that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.<br />(Luke 19:43) For the days will come upon you, when your enemies will set up a barricade around you and surround you and hem you in on every side<br />(Luke 19:44) and tear you down to the ground, you and your children within you. And they will not leave one stone upon another in you, because you did not know the time of your visitation.”<br />(Luke 19:45) And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold,<br />(Luke 19:46) saying to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a den of robbers.”<br />(Luke 19:47) And he was teaching daily in the temple. The chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people were seeking to destroy him,<br />(Luke 19:48) but they did not find anything they could do, for all the people were hanging on his words.\n\n<em><br />(Scripture quotations are from the English Standard Version. © Crossway. Used by permission. All rights reserved.)</em>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br />It’s almost that time of year again—when the whole world owes so\nmuch to one part of the Trinity: God’s Son, who became man—the King and\nLord of all men, Jesus of Nazareth.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>He is the only perfect being ever to have lived—and who still lives. The\none with the empty tomb, who died on a cross for you and me.</p>\n\n<p>I know many people don’t believe in God, much less Jesus. But honestly,\nwhen I look at the world around us, I can’t understand how anyone could\nthink that the Earth was created by some random cosmic collision—or\nwhatever the latest non-Christian scientific theory is today. In\ncomputer terms, that would be like saying existence came from an RNG\n(Random Number Generator).</p>\n\n<p>I look up at the sky—the way the moon and sun work in perfect harmony,\nand how so many supposedly “random” things had to come together for\nEarth to even be livable—and I can only come to one conclusion: this was\nthe work of a grand designer.</p>\n\n<p>Then I look at the Bible—not just at how historically accurate it is,\nbut at how prophetically true it proves to be. Scientists and historians\nalike have repeatedly confirmed its accuracy. And to me, one of the most\nconvincing examples in the entire Bible is the story of Daniel and his\nvision of the statue representing future nations and kingdoms—a vision\nthat has unfolded just as it was foretold.</p>\n\n<p>You know, Jesus wasn’t nervous from the moment He stepped onto Earth as\na man. He knew from the very beginning what the end would be—and what it\nwould accomplish.</p>\n\n<p>The Jews expected a king to arrive in glory, power, and wealth—like the\nkings and queens we think of today. But Jesus, the true King, didn’t\ncome in grandeur. He came in humility. And I think many refused to\naccept Him because He didn’t match their human expectations.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I think if I had witnessed even one of His miracles, I\nwould’ve believed on the spot. But I’ve read about them—and I do\nbelieve.</p>\n\n<p>Now jump to that moment when Jesus entered the city of Jerusalem on a\ndonkey.</p>\n\n<p>Do you ever wonder if the donkey knew—really knew—who it was carrying? I\nlike to think maybe it did.</p>\n\n<p>And then, as Jesus passed through those gates—He wasn’t welcomed by all.\nHe was ridiculed.</p>\n\n<p>He entered Jerusalem—not to the sight of a throne prepared for Him and\nthe sounds of thunderous applause, but to palm branches and cloaks laid\ndown by His true believers and disciples.</p>\n\n<p>He wasn’t received at the Temple as a king come to rule and lead His\npeople, but as a loon—a false prophet in the eyes of the religious\nelite.</p>\n\n<p>The Temple, the very heart of worship, had been turned into a\nmarketplace by the leaders entrusted to guard its sanctity. And Jesus\nknew they would oppose Him. This confrontation set the stage for Judas,\nwho was ripe for Satan’s influence, to act—joining forces with these\nso-called Pharisees, the very ones meant to shepherd God’s flock.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of leading with righteousness, they were focused on status,\ncontrol, and lining their pockets.</p>\n\n<p>If only they had believed.<br />If only they had fulfilled their\ncalling.<br />If only they hadn’t been deceived by the enemy.</p>\n\n<p>But Jesus knew—from the beginning of time—that this would be the\noutcome. Just as <strong>Pharaoh hardened his heart</strong> (see\n<em>Exodus 7–11</em>) and refused to let the Israelites go, these men\nwere walking the same path. They were sealing themselves for the same\nend: death and eternal condemnation.</p>\n\n<p>And even though Jesus knew His time was short,<br />He was determined to\nmake it known: <strong>What you are doing in this Temple is wrong.<br\n/></strong><br /></p>\n\n<p><br />Tags: #Easter #Jesus #PalmSunday #Holyweek</p>\n",

For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he!’ and, ‘The time is at hand!’ Do not go after them.\n(Luke 21:9) And when you hear of wars and tumults, do not be terrified, for these things must first take place, but the end will not be at once.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>After Jesus rebuked the Pharisees and drove out those misusing the Temple courtyard—turning what was meant to be a place for God into a market—He spoke many parables about what was to come. Then He turned His attention to the Last Supper and the betrayal that would soon unfold.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n\n<blockquote><p><strong>The Plot to Kill Jesus</strong>\n(Luke 22:1–6)</p>\n<p><strong>The Last Supper with the Disciples</strong>\n(Luke 22:7–23)</p></blockquote>\n<p>I often wonder what I would do if I had to keep a traitor close—knowing full well who they were, what they had done, and what they would do. After all that Judas had seen and experienced, he still betrayed Jesus. And yet, Jesus allowed him to remain.</p>\n<p>From the beginning of mankind’s fall, Judas was part of the plan. But I still don’t know if I could have stayed silent, let alone shared a table with someone I knew was plotting my death.</p>\n<p>That’s what only the <strong>Lord of Lords and King of Kings</strong> could do—show <strong>compassion</strong>, <strong>justice</strong>, and <strong>forgiveness</strong>, even in the face of betrayal.</p>\n<p>And I often wonder... if Judas had confessed, truly repented, and begged Jesus for forgiveness—would his fate have been different? Not the outcome of the cross, but his own redemption?</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives</strong>\n(Luke 22:39–46)</p></blockquote>\n<p>I sometimes think about how this moment looked through the eyes of the angels. What must they think of us? Why does the Lord, and God our Father, go to such great lengths for us?</p>\n<p>Surely they understand the reasons—but it still leaves me in awe.</p>\n<p>Who do you think that angel was that night in the Garden of Gethsemane? Do you think it was Gabriel? Michael? Or another unnamed messenger? Were they reassuring Jesus, offering comfort as He prepared to fulfill His mission? What was their conversation, if any?</p>\n<p>This moment in time—this night in the garden—feels like the most consequential since the birth of Jesus. From the arrest in Gethsemane to the hilltop at Calvary, the world would witness the <strong>greatest sacrifice</strong> and the <strong>greatest solution</strong> ever given.</p>\n<p>Then the arrest comes—and again, Jesus shows compassion instead of the might He could have displayed. Do you think He would have allowed them to touch Him if He hadn’t wanted it? And yet, even as one of His followers lashes out in fear, Jesus turns to <strong>heal the injured guard</strong>.</p>\n<p>At every turn, He shows that He has the power to do whatever He wants—<strong>but He only uses it to show mercy and understanding</strong>.</p>\n<p>What must that guard have thought, being instantly healed by the very man he came to arrest? I think I would have dropped to my knees right then and there, realizing I was standing before the <strong>Lord of Lords and King of Kings</strong>.</p>\n<p>But it’s easy for me to say that now. And still, I wonder: with so much eyewitness testimony, so much collaborating evidence—why do so many not believe?</p>\n<p>We are getting closer to the Cross.\nCloser to the sacrifice that would save a chosen species—for all time.</p>\n<p>Tags: <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:Easter\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">Easter</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:Gethsemane\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">Gethsemane</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:Passover\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">Passover</span></a> <a class=\"hashtag\" href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:Jesus\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">Jesus</span></a></p>\n",

Then on Sunday, I opened the Bee app to see what it had recorded and summarized from my day.\n\nAnd according to ***Bee’s AI***… this is what I did — all in a single day:\n\n<!--more-->\n\n------\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px; justify-content: center;\">   <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/screenshot-20250406-222502-bee.jpg\" width=\"250\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A person named Michael experiences a series of events including gaming issues, financial satisfactions with Discover and PayPal, and a puzzling investigation, which leaves him contemplating various scenarios.\">   <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/screenshot-20250406-222536-bee.jpg\" width=\"250\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A summary of a day's events is presented, highlighting issues with a weather project, financial review, and ongoing investigations.\">   <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/screenshot-20250406-222556-bee.jpg\" width=\"250\" alt=\"\"> </div>\n\n------\n\nA little context: the “friend” mentioned was actually my brother. And yes, I am Michael. But the rest? That came straight from an old episode of *Hunter* 📺 that was playing in the background while I was doing other things.\n\nSomehow, Bee’s AI blended my real day with gritty 1980s TV drama and decided I was in the middle of investigating a faked death 🕵️‍♂️, a dentist conspiracy 🦷, and $2 million in missing valuables 💰.\n\nIf I had actually done even one-tenth of what Bee thinks I did that day, I’d need to take the rest of the year off to recover. 🛌\n\nIn short? This thing is not ready for prime time. The Android app is extremely basic — and honestly, not great right now. But wow... what a laugh. I still can’t believe how confidently it generated this noir thriller summary of my otherwise chill weekend. 🤣\n\nImagine training a real AI model on stuff like this, thinking it’s an actual person’s daily life.\n\nHope you laugh as hard as I did. 😂\n\n\\#BeePioneer #AIHumor #WearableTech\n",

When I\nstarted looking for a new web host, my previous host included email in\nits shared hosting plan, which worked well initially. However, I\nexplored several alternatives, including Fastmail, but found it too\nexpensive for my needs. I also considered using my paid ProtonMail\naccount. While I could have used it for myself, it would have introduced\ncomplications for my parents, who are in their 70s and not very\ntech-savvy.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I began researching other email hosting providers and looked\ninto Purelymail (purelymail.com), Migadu (migadu.com), and finally,\nMXRoute (mxroute.com). After reading various reviews, MXRoute stood out\nas the best option. I was particularly drawn to its affordability: 25GB\nof storage for just $30 for three years (essentially $10 per year), with\nrenewals at the same price. Best of all, transitioning my parents’ email\nto MXRoute was effortless. I only had to update a few settings on their\ncomputers, and they didn’t even notice the change.</p>\n\n<p>This brings me to MXGuardDog.</p>\n\n<p>My mother, who freely shares her email address, receives a significant\namount of spam. I found that MXGuardDog (mxguarddog.com) was highly\nrecommended for effectively filtering spam. At less than $2 per month, I\ndecided to try it, and I’ve been using it for the past month. It\nprovides an easy and convenient way to monitor my mom’s inbox and filter\nout spam, ensuring she only receives legitimate emails and the\npromotional messages she actually wants.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m still within the first 30 days of using MXGuardDog, but I&#39;m already\nseeing her inbox clearing up on MXRoute. Overall, I&#39;m really happy with\nthis setup and glad I found both services. They were both easy to\nconfigure in my DNS records and started working immediately after I\nswitched over. I plan to write a longer-term review later this year, but\nso far, I&#39;m really impressed with both MXRoute and MXGuardDog.</p>\n\n<p>One aside: both MXRoute and MXGuardDog offer noticeably better spam\nprotection than Hotmail/Outlook accounts, which highlights a significant\ndifference in spam protection. Even Google’s Gmail outshines Microsoft’s\nspam and phishing protection.</p>\n\n<p>Tags: #EmailHosting #Spam #MXRoute #MXGuarddog</p>\n",

First and foremost, healthcare in this country has been in shambles for a long time.</p>\n<p>Throughout my career, I've always had employer-provided healthcare—through two government employers (state and county) and one private employer. I can say that the state-provided plan was the cheapest but middle-of-the-road in terms of quality. The county government plan was a little more expensive, but it was by far the best coverage I've ever had. Now, I work for a private employer, and while I'm grateful to have insurance, it has been the worst plan I've ever had—and I work for a hospital.</p>\n<p>All three employer-provided plans I've had were self-funded but administered by private companies. The prescription coverage across all of them was terrible, though the county plan was the best of the three.</p>\n<p>Currently, my employer switched from Aetna to UMR (a UnitedHealthcare subsidiary) for administering our plans. When I first started at the hospital, we had straight UnitedHealthcare for about two or three years, then switched to Aetna for the next ten years. Now, for the past couple of years, we've had UMR. Every year, the insurance has gotten worse. When I first started working, my insurance covered 90% of costs, and I had to cover 10%. Now, my employer only covers 70%, and we have to pay 30%.</p>\n<p>Lab work used to be fully covered under all my previous plans, including this employer's older plans. But now, we have to pay 30% of lab costs out of pocket.</p>\n<p>My father had insurance for both himself and my mother, and before he retired, their plan was the worst I had ever seen. Despite the high costs, the coverage was incredibly limited. However, at least their plan covered 100% of lab work—something my current plan no longer does.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-case-for-universal-healthcare\"><strong>The Case for Universal Healthcare</strong></h3>\n<p>Healthcare is one area where the United States lags behind other countries. I'm a non-party voter who tends to lean right on many issues, but when it comes to healthcare, I lean left—I believe it should be universal.</p>\n<p>Countries like the UK, Canada, Brazil, and Chile have implemented various forms of universal healthcare, each with their strengths and weaknesses. The UK's National Health Service (NHS) provides comprehensive coverage funded primarily through taxation. Canada's single-payer system covers all necessary medical services while allowing private insurance for supplemental needs. Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS) guarantees universal access despite funding challenges, while Chile's mixed public-private system offers universal coverage with tiered options.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are many questions: How do we pay for it? How do we solve the physician shortage? What would a functional system look like? By examining these international models, identifying what works and what doesn't, we could create a better healthcare system for the U.S.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-we-pay-for-it\"><strong>How Do We Pay for It?</strong></h3>\n<p>This is the biggest challenge. My idea is to take employer-provided health insurance and redirect what companies and governments currently pay for their workers into a national fund. If we combine all employer contributions, employee payments, and funding for existing programs like Veterans Affairs, Medicaid, and Medicare into a single universal healthcare fund, we could create a sustainable system.</p>\n<p>There are, of course, other sticking points—such as coverage for treatments that some citizens and government officials may find morally objectionable, like birth control or treatments for sexual dysfunction. My proposal would allow people to purchase private insurance for these services, making them accessible without requiring government funding.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if individuals and companies want to pay for additional private healthcare, they should have that option. A properly funded and well-organized universal healthcare system should be able to compete with private insurance. In my experience working in healthcare and observing other systems, what usually undermines universal healthcare is a lack of personnel and funding—two issues that we must address from the start.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-broken-system\"><strong>A Broken System</strong></h3>\n<p>As it stands, our current system is fragile and failing people. The UnitedHealthcare case highlights the extreme frustration many Americans feel toward our healthcare system. While I absolutely don't condone violence, the public reaction to this case reflects deep-seated anger over healthcare policies that prioritize profit over patient care.</p>\n<p>Health insurance companies have faced criticism for denying coverage, implementing policies that limit access to care, and contributing to the financial burden on patients. According to the 2023 Kaiser Family Foundation Employer Health Benefits Survey, the average annual premium for employer-sponsored family health coverage reached $23,968, with workers paying nearly $6,575 of that amount. The survey also found that family coverage premiums have risen 22% over the past five years while wages only increased by 27% during the same period.1</p>\n<p>These statistics represent real people facing impossible choices between paying for healthcare and meeting other basic needs. Insurance company policies designed to maximize shareholder value often result in restricted access to necessary treatments and medications.</p>\n<p>This is yet another reason we need universal healthcare. Healthcare should not be a privilege for those who can afford it—it should be a right, accessible to all, regardless of socioeconomic status. Will universal healthcare prevent all suffering? No. But it would ensure that every individual, regardless of their station in society, has an equal opportunity to pursue happiness and freedom—the very ideals our Founding Fathers envisioned for this country.</p>\n<p>The question isn't whether we can afford universal healthcare—it's whether we can afford to keep letting a broken system fail those who need it most, and whether the current employer-sponsored system is truly sustainable or affordable.</p>\n<h5 id=\"footnotes\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></h5>\n<p>[<strong>1</strong>]  Kaiser Family Foundation.

I canceled <strong>Apple TV+</strong> a few months\nago. There are TV programs I like on both, but I just can't justify it\nanymore. These subscriptions are like vampires, siphoning a few dollars\nhere and there until my budget is bled dry. These little charges are\nstarting to eat away at my budget.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>There have been numerous articles about how our society is turning into\none big rental/subscription economy, where we don’t own anything—we just\nrent it. To keep track of my expenses, I now maintain a spreadsheet of\nall my subscriptions, noting whether I pay monthly, yearly, or on a\nfixed term. Whenever possible, I choose <strong>y</strong>early payments\nsince they usually come with a small discount.</p>\n\n<p>I've also started investing in a couple of Raspberry Pis to self-host as\nmuch as possible. But there are some services I won’t compromise on. One\nof them is my managed Mastodon instance from\n<strong>Masto.host</strong>. The service removes the strain of\nmaintenance, even for a single-user instance, and it’s actually cheaper\nthan my previous setup using the smallest available<strong>\nDigitalOcean</strong> server. Choosing <strong>Masto.host</strong> was\nan excellent decision—<strong>Hugo Gameiro</strong> does a fantastic job\nwith managed Mastodon hosting.</p>\n\n<p>Another service <strong>I wouldn’t think of cutting</strong> is\n<strong>Micro.blog</strong>. I only recently started using it, but I’m\nalready very impressed. <strong>Manton Reece</strong>, like Hugo, runs a\ntight and reliable service. I don’t mind paying for superior service and\ntime-saving convenience.</p>\n\n<p>That said, there are plenty of subscriptions—<em>or as I call them,\nleases</em>—that I don’t mind cutting. I hate car leases and have never\nhad one; I’d rather<em> own my stuff than rent it</em>. My parents,\nbrother, and sister-in-law all tried leasing a car once, and they\nlearned their lesson, too.</p>\n\n<p>Tags:  #CutTheCord  #SmartSpending </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img alt=\"A determined programmer sitting at a cluttered desk with multiple screens showing lines of code and AI chatbot responses. Floating digital assistants\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/w07xpvd0.webp\"/></p>\n<p>It all started with a simple question: <em>Can I take an RSS feed from one blog and feed it to another?</em></p>\n<p>I knew that my Write.as blog automatically generated an RSS feed and that I used to import posts directly into Micro.blog. However, I was running into issues with duplicate posts. So, I had an idea—why not see if ChatGPT could help me or if there was already a program that could parse an RSS feed and pull it into Micro.blog?</p>\n<p>ChatGPT confirmed that it was possible. It suggested that I use my Raspberry Pi to run a script that would fetch the feed, filter out what I didn't need, and then push the cleaned-up version to Micro.blog.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3 id=\"diving-into-the-world-of-ai-assisted-coding\"><strong>Diving Into the World of AI-Assisted Coding</strong></h3>\n<p>My coding experience was minimal. I had learned QBasic in college over 30 years ago and had taken an introductory Python course about a decade ago. In other words, I had just enough knowledge to get myself into trouble. So, I knew I’d have to rely almost entirely on AI to guide me through this project.</p>\n<p>To ensure quality, I decided to use Gemini as a kind of QA checker. I told ChatGPT what I wanted to do, and as it generated lines of code, I would copy and paste them into Gemini for review. Gemini would provide assessments and suggestions, which I then fed back into ChatGPT for refinement.</p>\n<p>I assumed this process would take just a few hours. Instead, it turned into a multi-day battle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-struggle-begins\"><strong>The Struggle Begins</strong></h3>\n<p>ChatGPT walked me through setting up everything I needed on my Raspberry Pi 5. Once everything was in place, I ran the script—and immediately encountered error after error.</p>\n<p>For the rest of the day, I went back and forth between ChatGPT and Gemini, tweaking the code, troubleshooting issues, and starting new chats when things got too messy. Thirteen hours later, I was exhausted and felt like I was getting nowhere.</p>\n<p>I decided to sleep on it.</p>\n<p>The next morning, the code was working, but not quite the way I wanted. Then I had another idea—what if I made it capable of parsing multiple feeds? That way, I could also include my Pixelfed RSS feed in the future.</p>\n<p>So, I told ChatGPT what I wanted. It dutifully generated updates, which I then checked with Gemini. But this time, I started getting frustrated. Both AI models were telling me that the code was “finished,” yet it wasn't working correctly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-ai-character-limit-problem\"><strong>The AI Character Limit Problem</strong></h3>\n<p>I had ChatGPT regenerate the full script after multiple iterations, thinking it would be easier to copy and paste the entire thing rather than piecing together small edits. However, as the script grew longer, I noticed that I was running into more and more errors.</p>\n<p>By Sunday, I was completely burnt out. I decided to step away for the rest of the weekend and revisit it after work on Monday.</p>\n<p>Monday and Tuesday evenings were spent refining the script. I finally had something that worked—but not quite how I needed it to.</p>\n<p>I also noticed something strange: ChatGPT and Gemini were no longer giving me the full code back after updates. Instead, they were only returning partial sections. I switched to Perplexity AI to see if it handled things better.</p>\n<p>At this point, I was also running into another problem—the script was struggling to properly isolate the post signature that I use on Write.as. I wanted this signature automatically removed, since it wasn't needed for Micro.blog.</p>\n<p>To troubleshoot, I enlisted <strong>four different AI models</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>ChatGPT</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Gemini</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Claude</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Perplexity AI</strong></li></ul>\n<p>Still, I kept noticing that my script was getting shorter instead of longer. Even though each AI claimed to be providing the full code, something was missing.</p>\n<p>That’s when I finally asked ChatGPT why this was happening.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ai-s-hidden-limitation\"><strong>AI’s Hidden Limitation</strong></h3>\n<p>It turns out that most AI models struggle with long outputs. They can ingest large amounts of text, but when it comes to outputting a complete response, they often lose track of their place or hit character limits.</p>\n<p>Even though I was using the paid version of ChatGPT, it still couldn't return my full script. This was true for Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity as well.</p>\n<p>That’s when ChatGPT suggested I try Cursor AI—an AI coding assistant that supposedly didn’t have these limitations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-breakthrough\"><strong>The Breakthrough</strong></h3>\n<p>Sure enough, Cursor AI was able to output my entire script in one go. With that, I finally finished my project. The script worked exactly as I wanted—it pulled only new Write.as posts and formatted them cleanly for Micro.blog.</p>\n<p>The final step was testing, and it worked perfectly.</p>\n<p>After nearly five days of trial and error, I had my working script. I immediately canceled my ChatGPT Plus subscription and switched to Cursor AI's paid plan instead. The free versions of AI assistants are fine for everyday needs, but for coding, Cursor AI is my new go-to (unless something better comes along).</p>\n<h3 id=\"lessons-learned\"><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></h3>\n<p>For a while, I thought these AI models were intentionally stringing me along by making minor errors in the code or withholding parts of it. But in reality, they just weren’t capable of outputting long responses in a single attempt.</p>\n<p>Because Cursor AI runs locally on my machine (while still leveraging cloud capabilities), it doesn’t have the same output limitations.</p>\n<p>In the end, my final script ended up being around 360 lines of code—but all the other AI models could only output about 123 lines at best before getting cut off.</p>\n<p>Despite the struggle, I learned a lot—not just about coding, but about how AI tools work.</p>\n",

I watch it\nalmost every night and own the entire series on DVD. Why am I telling\nyou this? Because lately, as I’ve been watching it, I’ve been thinking a\nlot about what’s going on in this country politically. And you know\nwhat? Trump is like Archie Bunker—but worse.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n<p><br />The character of Archie Bunker and Trump have a lot in common.\nBoth are New Yorkers. Both have racist tendencies—though I believe\nArchie’s stem from ignorance and learned behavior, while Trump's words\nand actions often suggest a belief that people of different races are\nlesser in intelligence and quality. Both refuse to admit when they don’t\nknow or understand something. Both lie to cover this up. Both rely\nheavily on stereotypes. And both paint Republicans and politicians in a\nbad light. (For the record, Archie was a Republican.)</p>\n\n<p><br />The key difference? Archie had redeeming qualities. His ignorance\nand intolerance were rooted in tradition and, more importantly, a lack\nof education. He was a working-class, politically incorrect character\nwhose views were shaped by his upbringing and limited worldview, yet he\nhad moments of growth and self-reflection. Trump, on the other hand,\npresents himself as an authoritative figure who rarely, if ever,\nacknowledges mistakes or changes his stance. Unlike Archie, Trump isn’t\njust a product of his environment—he has had education, wealth, and\naccess to knowledge, yet he still chooses ignorance.</p>\n\n<p><br />Trump displays traits often associated with narcissism.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Narcissism</strong>, as defined by the Mayo Clinic:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\"Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental health condition in which people have an unreasonably high sense of their own importance. They need and seek too much attention and want people to admire them. People with this disorder may lack the ability to understand or care about the feelings of others. But behind this mask of extreme confidence, they are not sure of their self-worth and are easily upset by the slightest criticism.\" </blockquote>\n\n<p>Archie, by contrast, was simply uneducated and ignorant, not\npathologically self-absorbed. A lot of Trump’s followers are similar—not\nnecessarily bad people, but uneducated, just like Archie, believing\nthings should work a certain way and struggling to see beyond their own\nlogic. That said, education makes a difference. Some argue that Trump\nsurrounds himself with “smart people,” but those individuals are often\njust looking out for themselves—focused on keeping the government out of\ntheir paychecks, bank accounts, and backroom deals.</p>\n\n<p>Both Archie and Trump appeal to a certain nostalgia for a bygone era,\nbut their approaches to race, politics, and personal responsibility are\nfundamentally different. Archie represented an older generation\nstruggling to adapt to change, yet his story was one of potential\ngrowth—when confronted with new ideas, he could learn, even if\nreluctantly. Trump, however, doubles down on division and refuses to\ngrow.</p>\n\n<p>Archie also had Edith, who balanced him out with compassion. Trump\ndoesn’t have that—he has only enablers. And even if he did, a narcissist\ncan’t be wrong in their own mind. Archie had the one thing Trump will\nnever have, and I don’t think it’s possible with a transactional\nnarcissist like Trump: in the end, Archie had compassion and could see\nthe other person’s point of view.</p>\n\n<blockquote>This post reflects my personal opinions and interpretations. It is not intended as a statement of fact but as political and cultural commentary.</blockquote>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><strong>A Little History</strong></p>\n<p>I started blogging back in 2001, beginning with Blogger—probably like many others at the time. I remained on Blogger even after Google acquired the platform in 2003. However, I wasn’t a prolific blogger back then. Instead, I focused on maintaining a personal website where I frequently updated content, mainly pictures. At the time, I used my ISP’s residential web hosting service, which was included in my package, and built my site with Microsoft FrontPage. I became very proficient with FrontPage and really miss it—but I digress.</p>\n<p>When Microsoft FrontPage was discontinued and ISP-provided web hosting started disappearing, Blogger remained. So, I began using it more and more. I also started using Microsoft Live Writer—another great tool that unfortunately disappeared.</p>\n<p>For many years, I stuck with Blogger. Later, I experimented with WordPress, but I found it difficult to use and wasn’t impressed. Then came all the hullabaloo surrounding one of WordPress’s creators/owners. After dealing with the chaos at Twitter under Elon Musk, I was eager to find alternatives.</p>\n<p>I considered sticking with my Blogger account and began posting there again, alongside using my self-hosted Mastodon instance, which I had set up to replace Twitter. But it just wasn’t the same.</p>\n<p>After researching Write.as and Micro.blog, I debated whether to just stay with Blogger. In the end, I decided to do all of them.</p>\n<p>First, I signed up for Write.as. Then, a few days later, I joined Micro.blog. I subscribed to the paid plans on both platforms to explore their full features.\n<em>(Write.as will be the subject of a separate post soon.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Discovering Micro.blog</strong></p>\n<p>As I started digging into Micro.blog and figuring out all its features, I was really impressed. I like how it seamlessly combines blogging, social media, and web hosting.</p>\n<p>That said, the platform leans heavily towards the Apple ecosystem (macOS and iOS). There’s a web editor, a macOS app, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and even a Firefox extension for bookmarking sites—but no Windows app.</p>\n<p>I’ve structured my Micro.blog site to resemble the layout I once had on my FrontPage-built site (with one key exception, the photo gallery ). At its core, I now have a fully integrated blog. Federation handles the social media aspect.</p>\n<p>Micro.blog not only federates with Mastodon, Pixelfed, and Bluesky, but it also connects with Meta properties (like Threads) and Automattic services (like Tumblr). Additionally, you can import content into your blog via RSS feeds, turning various sources into blog posts automatically.</p>\n<p>Since I use a custom domain with Cloudflare, I was happy to see that Micro.blog works well with Cloudflare DNS. Setting up a custom domain with Micro.blog was seamless, and Cloudflare’s security features provide an extra layer of protection.</p>\n<p><strong>User Experience &amp; Mobile Apps</strong></p>\n<p>Micro.blog is built on Hugo, users who are comfortable with Hugo’s templating system can deeply customize their sites. While the default theming is simple, those familiar with Hugo can modify templates, tweak layouts, and enhance functionality. For those who aren’t as comfortable with coding, Micro.blog’s built-in themes and plugins offer plenty of flexibility.</p>\n<p>Micro.blog has a vibrant plugin community. There are a lot of third-party themes from <a href=\"mattlangford.com\">Matt Langford</a> and <a href=\"jimmitchell.org\">Jim Mitchell</a> (not related, as far as I know). You can host podcasts with Micro.blog and send newsletters.</p>\n<p>For mobile users, there are apps for both iOS and Android. Since I primarily use Android, I can’t speak much about the iOS apps, but the Micro.blog Android app feels feature-rich.</p>\n<p>Micro.blog also offers companion apps, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Epilogue</strong> (for book tracking)</li>\n<li><strong>Strata</strong> (for notes)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s also <strong>Sunlit</strong>, a photo-sharing app for iOS, and an Android version is expected in the future.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We aren’t planning to develop a Windows app for Micro.blog, but I would like to have an Android app for Sunlit one day. <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> Ideally, all of our mobile apps would be available for both iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>If you find a good standards-based app for Windows that works with Micro.blog, let us know! We can link to it from Micro.blog so more people know about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Micro.blog&rsquo;s federation features have made me reconsider whether I really need to maintain my own Mastodon instance. While I still appreciate some of Mastodon’s features, like boosting or favoriting posts, the managed hosting I have through Masto.host has been fantastic.</p>\n<p>I have already imported my Mastodon following list to Micro.blog, which would make a transition smoother in the future if I decide to shut down my Mastodon instance. One of Micro.blog’s biggest advantages is POSSE (Publish Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere), allowing me to post on my own platform while automatically syndicating content to other networks. This makes my decision about whether to keep my Mastodon instance an interesting one for the future.</p>\n<p><strong>The Downsides</strong></p>\n<p>While I’ve found plenty of positives, there are a few negatives—though I really had to dig for them.</p>\n<p>The writer/editor is not What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG). From what I can tell, it’s a mix of HTML and Markdown. Since I’m not well-versed in either, there has been a bit of a learning curve.

Honestly, not much. But a few things come to mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A better web writer</li>\n<li>A Windows app on par with the macOS app (my dream)</li>\n<li>A way to sort people I follow by platform (i.e., Micro.blog, Mastodon, Bluesky, or others)</li>\n<li>An easy way to create a photo gallery that isn’t tied to a blog post and can be added to navigation</li>\n<li>A way to hide the default photo page (this might just be something I need to learn how to do)</li>\n<li>A Mastodon-style share extension plugin for Firefox</li>\n<li>Easier category management (editing, renaming, and reorganizing)</li>\n<li>Support for tags to better organize posts</li>\n<li>Hashtag support for social media cross-posting (so hashtags in a Micro.blog post properly transfer to Mastodon, Bluesky, etc.)</li>\n<li>Ensure images display consistently across different post layouts, avoiding issues where images appear off to the side in two-line view but display correctly in three-line view (similar to what I experienced with Scribbles, which was reported).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these features may already be supported, and I just need to learn where they are and how to use them. If so, I welcome any pointers from the community!</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>\n<p>For my needs and wants, Micro.blog is an 8 out of 10. Like Masto.host, this is an independently owned service with a beautiful array of features, constant development, and refinement.

				"content_text": "<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/fscdtrsk.webp\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>I have a multifaceted plan to restore integrity to the U.S. representative governing system. While I am not naive enough to believe this could happen through Congress alone, I think it is high time the states called for a Constitutional Convention. Such conventions should likely occur regularly, perhaps every 150 to 200 years.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Many argue that calling a Constitutional Convention could lead to states going off the rails—a runaway convention. That is why, before convening, the convention should be limited in scope, and its representatives should pledge not to deviate from the established agenda unless three-fourths of the state legislatures agree to any new items once the convention has started.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Legislative Branch</strong></p>\n\n<p>For Congress, this is how I propose fixing it, starting with the House of Representatives. The House was designed to be the branch of government closest to the people—not to political parties—but to the constituents they represent. With the U.S. population exceeding 330 million, the current representation ratio does not favor adequate representation. Each representative in the House currently serves, on average, 747,000[<sup>1</sup>] people.</p>\n\n<p>We are fast approaching an oligarchy if we do not improve this ratio. Increasing the number of representatives would reduce the concentration of power among a few individuals or corporations. Currently, corporations can influence or buy off 435 representatives relatively easily. If the number of representatives increased to 11,000, this would be far less feasible. Additionally, many representatives would serve districts without large corporations, focusing instead on small businesses and local constituents, making them more responsive to the people they represent.</p>\n\n<p>Adding this number of representatives all at once would be impractical, so I propose a staggered approach. This ties into my next proposal to improve the House: extending representatives' terms to six years. An amendment should require Congress to maintain a representative-to-population ratio of 1:50,000 and enforce term limits of two terms. These limits would apply to both chambers of Congress, allowing for a maximum of two terms in either the House or Senate, or one in each chamber—but not exceeding a total of two terms, whether served consecutively or not.</p>\n\n<p>There should also be a maximum age limit of 74. A person could run for Congress and serve up to age 74. If they turn 74 while serving, they could complete their full term but would not be eligible for re-election. No one over the age of 74 could run. This age limit could be changed by Constitutional Amendment and Ratification by three-fourths of the states. Such an amendment would have only one calendar year to pass; if not ratified within this time frame, it would become null and void.</p>\n\n<p>The staggered implementation would work as follows: the current 435 representatives would serve six-year terms. During the first election after the amendment, 4,500 additional representatives would be added. Two years later, another 4,500 would be added. Finally, in the next election cycle, the remaining seats required to meet the new ratio would be added. This phased approach allows for gradual adjustment while ensuring that representatives have time to focus on serving their constituents instead of campaigning constantly.</p>\n\n<p>This expanded House would also allow Congress to reclaim powers that have been delegated to independent agencies like the SEC, FCC, and FTC. By hiring talent from these agencies as staffers, representatives would have the time and expertise to draft legislation directly. This approach would nullify Supreme Court decisions that allow bureaucrats to make laws and rules instead of Congress[<sup>2</sup>]. With representatives serving smaller constituencies of 50,000 people, the voices of individual citizens would be amplified, and representatives would be more accountable to their communities.</p>\n\n<p>For the Senate, I propose increasing its size to 500 members but with a key distinction: term limits would mirror those outlined for the House. Of these 500 members, 300 would be elected by direct election as they are now, while the remaining 200 would be appointed by state legislatures, similar to the system before the Seventeenth Amendment. The original method of legislative appointment had merit, as it was intended to create a more measured and insulated institution.</p>\n\n<p>Direct elections have blurred the Senate's unique purpose, making it feel like a smaller, longer-serving version of the House. To address this, the 300 elected Senators would serve for the first three years, and three years later, the 200 appointed Senators would take office and be designated as Senior Senators. Both groups—elected and appointed—would adhere to the same term limits, ensuring that no member could serve more than two terms. This structure helps prevent the entrenchment of career politicians, many of whom today remain in office until death or incapacity.</p>\n\n<p>By adopting these reforms, we can restore balance and integrity to our representative governing system, making it more responsive to the needs of the American people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Executive Branch</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are also Executive Branch reforms needed. The President and the Vice President should remain as is. However, the age limit of 74 shall also apply to the President and Vice President. If the President or Vice President turns 74 while serving their first term, they shall not run again but may finish their term. This can only be changed by the same Constitutional Amendment process as for Congress.</p>\n\n<p>Further changes to the Executive Branch via Constitutional Amendments include ensuring that the President is not immune from the Laws of the Land. Operational decisions directly related to the President's job and within the guidelines of established law shall not be reviewed for legality for criminal or civil purposes and shall not be examined by Courts or Congress once the serving President’s term ends. However, any actions taken outside of these operational necessities may be investigated post-term only if they are criminal and violated the existing laws of the United States at the time they were executed.</p>\n\n<p>The President's Pardon Power is revoked. Instead, a Pardon Board shall be established, consisting of 1 member appointed by each Chamber of Congress, 1 member by the Supreme Court, 1 member by the President, 1 member by the Vice President, and 1 member from each state. This board shall be appointed by the second month of a President's term and shall meet quarterly to submit names for pardons or commutations to the President and Congress. Only this board may grant pardons or commutations, and Congress shall establish statutory guidelines for its operation. The Supreme Court shall have one month to review or state plainly why an individual recommendation is denied. A simple majority vote will suffice for approval or denial. There will be no appeals, and decisions shall be final. Crimes related to the Death Penalty, Insurrection, and Treason shall be ineligible for pardon or commutation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Supreme Court</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court shall be expanded to 1 Justice for every 2 States, plus 1 extra Justice and 1 Chief Justice, ensuring an odd number of Justices including the Chief Justice. The Court shall be expanded by 2 Justices every 4 years until the maximum is reached. Supreme Court Justices shall be selected by a non-partisan board, which shall maintain a list of 25 names each year, ordered alphabetically. The President may only nominate Justices from this list, subject to Congressional confirmation.</p>\n\n<p>The same age restriction for Congress, the President, and the Vice President shall apply to the Supreme Court and the Federal Judiciary. Additionally, a Federal Judge at any level may serve for either 28 years or until they reach 74 years of age, whichever comes first.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous Constitutional Amendments</strong></p>\n\n<p>Congress shall not fund any laws without fully funding them and is prohibited from transferring federal mandates and the costs of federal laws to the states.</p>\n\n<p>A constitutional amendment shall prohibit gerrymandering of congressional districts. Districts must be drawn to form contiguous blocks. A non-partisan board, appointed by representatives from all three branches of government and consisting of 15 members, shall be established two years before any election to review any changes to congressional districts. Any challenge to this board’s decision shall be heard immediately by the Supreme Court and must be resolved within two months before an election. If the challenge arises too close to an election, the Supreme Court shall resolve it within three days of the hearing.</p>\n\n<p>All independent agencies not under the Executive Branch shall remain outside of its purview. Only Congress shall have the authority to reduce, expand, or fund these agencies appropriately. The Executive Branch shall have no power or authority over independent agencies. The House and Senate must pass, by a two-thirds vote, any measure to create or eliminate an independent agency. The heads of these agencies shall be appointed by Congress and shall be subject to removal through Congress’s impeachment power.</p>\n\n<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) shall be removed from the Executive Branch and established as an independent agency with the authority to conduct investigations free from political influence. The DOJ shall be headed by the Attorney General, who shall serve a five-year term. This term may be renewed once by Congress, but shall not exceed ten years, whether consecutive or not. The DOJ shall have an oversight board consisting of 11 members, nominated as follows: two by the President, two by the Vice President, two by the House, two by the Senate, and three by the Supreme Court. The oversight board shall act on concerns and recommendations from a non-partisan Inspector General, who shall be appointed by Congress. Both the oversight board members and the Inspector General shall serve a single 11-year term. The Attorney General, oversight board members, and the Inspector General shall be subject to removal through Congress’s impeachment power.</p>\n\n<p>The DOJ shall have the authority to investigate the Executive Branch for treason, insurrection, and criminal violations committed by any individual within the Executive Branch. If the investigation involves a sitting President or Vice President, the DOJ must complete its inquiry within six to nine months and submit its findings to the House for impeachment proceedings. If the House votes to impeach, the Senate must conduct a trial no later than one week after receiving the articles of impeachment. If the House votes not to impeach, the DOJ’s full report shall be made public, unredacted, within 120 days—except for information that pertains to individuals not involved in criminality or that could pose a national security risk.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Balanced Budget Amendment</strong></p>\n\n<p>A constitutional amendment shall mandate a balanced budget, with trust-funded activities exempted. The President shall have line-item veto power, which Congress may override with a two-thirds vote.</p>\n\n<p>The national debt shall be eliminated within 75 years, after which the measures used to achieve debt elimination shall remain in effect for an additional 10 years to create a budget surplus. After this surplus period, these extraordinary fiscal measures shall expire, and standard budgetary practices shall resume.</p>\n\n<p>Congress may suspend the national debt elimination plan at any time during a national emergency, war, or economic crisis with a two-thirds vote in both chambers. Such a suspension shall be valid for a maximum of two years per vote. If the crisis persists, Congress must vote again to extend the suspension for another two-year period, ensuring regular accountability and preventing indefinite postponements.</p>\n\n<p>-—</p>\n\n<p><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is my comprehensive plan to refine the federal government and further our Founding Fathers’ vision of a living Constitution. Since past and present Congresses lack the political will to implement these reforms, the states should call for a constitutional amendment. By limiting the scope of their convention, concerns about a runaway convention could be alleviated.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, I have avoided addressing social issues.

He removed one polyp, and it was likely benign. The pathology\nresults confirmed that it was indeed benign. The doctor also mentioned\nthat I won’t need another colonoscopy for seven years—just two years\nbefore I retire.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>I'm planning for retirement in the next decade and thinking about how to\nbalance savings, Social Security, and other income sources. My goal is\nto live off my savings and retirement funds (hopefully without\nexhausting them) before transitioning fully to Social Security and other\nfinancial resources.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of Social Security, I don’t understand why politicians\nconstantly attack it. They’re the ones who created it, and in doing so,\nthey contributed to the disappearance of defined pension plans. Of\ncourse, that’s not the only reason—corporate greed was probably the main\nfactor. It infuriates me every time a politician says, “We have to cut\nentitlements.” I always think to myself: It’s called an entitlement\nbecause you took my money, used it to run the government, and promised\nto give it back. So yes, I am entitled to it.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I do believe Social Security needs to be reformed. I think\nthe cap should be raised to $1 million, and the tax rate should probably\nbe around 9%. I know that means less money now, but it would ensure\nreliable income later. I also believe the early retirement age should\ngradually increase from 62 to 64, while the Medicare eligibility age\nshould be lowered to 64 so that people can access both at the same time.\nThe full retirement age should remain at 67, though I could live with\n68—but no higher than that.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I’m looking forward to retirement with great anticipation.</p>\n",

I’m not a techie—just a wannabe\ntechie with some computer skills. Mainly, I have enough knowledge to\nrecognize patterns and handle simple tasks.</p>\n\n<p>With the advent of ChatGPT (which I’ve found to be the best so far), I’m\ntrying to step out of my comfort zone and learn new things. However,\nI’ve had to rely on ChatGPT for Portainer YAML files, Docker, Docker\nCompose, and setting up my Raspberry Pi 5 in a Pironman 5 case. I\nassembled the hardware myself, but when it came to the software, I\nneeded ChatGPT’s help.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Out of the eight containers/stacks I’ve attempted to set up, only about\ntwo successfully deployed with ChatGPT’s initial guidance. The rest\nrequired a lot of tinkering—feeding logs to ChatGPT, troubleshooting\nerrors, and making adjustments—before I finally got them working.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this such a chore? I know Linux is different from Windows, but\none thing I can say about Windows is that as long as software is\ndesigned for it, you just click the installer, and nine times out of\nten, it works. And if it doesn’t, an update usually fixes it.</p>\n\n<p>I like GUIs. The last time I dealt with the command line on a daily\nbasis was in the DOS era. I understand that the command line can be\npowerful, but it’s also error-prone—one small typo can break everything.\nPoint-and-click was a marvelous invention!  #SelfHosting #TechLearning \n#Docker #RaspberryPi </p>\n",

Technically, there are more choices than\never before, which makes things both simpler and more complex. Options\nlike WordPress, Google's Blogger, Bear Blog, Micro.blog, Hugo, Write.as,\nScribbles, and many more exist today.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>The <em>less complicated</em> part is actually writing. Not that the\ntopics themselves aren’t complex, but once you pick a platform, there’s\nlittle to no setup. In the past, setting up a blog required a lot of\neffort. Then Blogger came along and made it easy. Then Google bought\nBlogger, and Microsoft launched Live Writer. That’s when things went\ndownhill for a while. Live Writer is gone, and Blogger has stagnated\nunder Google. I often wonder where Blogger would be today if Google had\nnever acquired it. I like to think it could have been the dominant force\nin blogging, constantly innovating.</p>\n\n<p>Then social media platforms came along—Myspace (I never used it),\nFacebook (I quickly saw what they were about and left), and Twitter. Now\n<em>Twitter</em> was my jam. I loved Twitter before Elon. I even owned a\nfew shares of the stock at different times. I was hoping they would\nfully flesh out their idea of offering extra features to stockholders.\nBut now, blogging is making a comeback because billionaires, never\nsatisfied with what they have, have ruined those platforms.</p>\n\n<p>As I continue my blogging journey, I’m trying to escape what I see as\nthe coming collapse of WordPress—yet another unhinged millionaire\nwanting to become a billionaire. I’ve signed up for Scribbles,\nMicro.blog, and Write.as while abandoning my self-hosted WordPress site.\nI’m keeping Blogger as a backup (it’s my longest-running blogging\nplatform). I’m not sure where I’ll ultimately settle. I might keep all\nthese services, but right now, I’m leaning toward Micro.blog, Blogger\n(since it’s free), and Scribbles. I’ve read a lot of good things about\nScribbles, and I really like this editor.</p>\n\n<p>Which brings me to my last rant—why do all these services have great iOS\nand macOS apps while Android and Windows users are left behind or given\ninferior versions? I’d love an Android and Windows app that lets you\nwrite once, add media, format your post, and then publish to multiple\nplatforms at once.</p>\n",

After a couple of days of trying and doing a little research, and admittedly finding no firm answer, the consensus is that it is offline and has shut down permanently. It shut down unceremoniously and without warning. That site was a great resource for finding savings with your ISP and checking if you were the only one experiencing service problems. It will be missed, and I’m not sure if anyone could step in, though I hope so.\n    <br><br>\n    This seems to be a trend happening more and more.

I’ve recently started dabbling with setting up a Raspberry Pi and self-hosting different services. I began with Pi-Hole because I’m just tired of all the ads. While this hasn’t eliminated all of them, it’s removed about 80 percent, which is a big improvement.</p>\n\n<p>I’m also moving away from shared hosting (once my contract ends) because of the WordPress kerfuffle, the high pricing of my shared hosting, and WordPress nickel-and-diming for every little add-on. On top of that, I’ve grown frustrated with how complicated WordPress has become. I believe I’ve found the perfect solution, but all of this comes at a cost. I’m definitely stretching my comfort zone with technology and encountering new challenges along the way.</p>\n\n<p>One challenge I’ve encountered is that most of the best blogging tools are only available for macOS, iOS, or iPadOS. Since I use Windows and Android, I often feel left out in the cold. Writing once and then publishing everywhere I want to is not as simple as it should be. I often find myself either cutting and pasting or using awkward workarounds.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:SelfHosting\" class=\"hashtag\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">SelfHosting</span></a> <a href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:TechChallenges\" class=\"hashtag\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">TechChallenges</span></a> <a href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:RaspberryPi\" class=\"hashtag\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">RaspberryPi</span></a> <a href=\"https://michaelmitchell.blog/tag:WordPress\" class=\"hashtag\"><span>#</span><span class=\"p-category\">WordPress</span></a></p>\n",

Number 1 thing I am thankful for is my salvation that our Lord and Savior Jesus gave us all. I am thankful for my family. I am thankful Jesus has improved my health this year through the knowledge and wisdom of my doctors. I am thankful Jesus provides me with a job so that I can meet my needs and enjoy some extras, even though I probably have too many things.</p>\n\n<p>So I have a lot I am thankful for and hope and pray that Jesus carries me forward into 2025 with the list above and improvement. I really want to expand my  technology knowledge level. That is a main goal for next year. But I think the biggest goal for next year is to chip away at significant portions of debt. As I approach retirement,  I need to eliminate my debts.</p>\n\n<p>Well I hope everyone else enjoyed their 2024 Thanksgiving Day and got as stuffed on food as I did.

It has been a while since I posted an update and thought I would cover the end of August 2024 and September 2024. Health-wise, I have actually not been great. I started Mounjaro to help with some weight loss and diabetic control (even though my A1C is not too bad: 6.1 as of my last one). The Mounjaro has caused a lot of gastrointestinal issues for me and they have not stopped or lessened. Actually, with the increase of dose (currently on the 7.25mg) it has gotten worse. I have lost some weight, approximately 16 pounds, but I don't know if the side effects are worth it. Due to my obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and asthma, I can't exercise like someone without these conditions. I am hoping to hold out and finish the six doses I have left (possibly going to every other week) to help lessen the side effects. I would rather lose some weight, allow my stomach to contract, and hopefully keep off the weight with the smaller stomach. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also had an echocardiogram in early August and it shows my left atrium stretching even more worse. Not sure if my condition is worsening the doctor will let me know but the reading doctor had a lot of worse off and worsening in her report. I do know I feel more tired a lot more and get out of wind walking to my desk from my car at work. But I haven't had any new issues of AFib (which is a good thing). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I bought a Pixie Dust Walt Disney World Annual ticket last year and have gone a total of 3 times with it. One time just after buying it for a day. Then the other 2 for a week once and then 3 days for another. The first week of May 2024 I went and got hurt falling. So this kind of dampened the trip for me. Then we went again at the end of August 2024 for a couple of days and stayed at one of the hotels that have the Skyliners. Well, I got hurt again this time on the ride Tron. Don't ask me how it happened; I don't know but I got what appeared to be a small skin abrasion that turned into a 2-week nightmare and an abrasion that ended with the size of almost 2 half-dollar coins. Both times it was my left leg and side and both times just before visiting EPCOT. This put a damper on me enjoying myself even though I really was up until I was hurt. I have decided to give Disney World a break. Below are some of the pictures of my second trip.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<div class=\"microblog_collection\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/2024-08-26-magic-kingdom-park-adventureland-3-1536x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"A group of four people posing in front of the Adventureland entrance at a theme park.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://mlm361.micro.blog/uploads/2025/2024-08-26-magic-kingdom-park-adventureland-3-1536x1024.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/2024-08-26-magic-kingdom-park-haunted-mansion-1024x1536.jpeg\" alt=\"Two people are sitting on a ride at The Haunted Mansion with ghostly figures around them.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://mlm361.micro.blog/uploads/2025/2024-08-26-magic-kingdom-park-haunted-mansion-1024x1536.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/2024-08-26-magic-kingdom-park-haunted-mansion-2-1024x1536.jpeg\" alt=\"Two people on a theme park ride appear surprised while a ghostly figure looms behind them, set within a decorative frame.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://mlm361.micro.blog/uploads/2025/2024-08-26-magic-kingdom-park-haunted-mansion-2-1024x1536.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/2024-08-26-magic-kingdom-park-pirates-of-the-caribbean-1536x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"A group of people are riding a themed amusement park attraction with a Pirates of the Caribbean motif.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://mlm361.micro.blog/uploads/2025/2024-08-26-magic-kingdom-park-pirates-of-the-caribbean-1536x1024.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/2024-08-26-magic-kingdom-park-tron-lightcycle-run-1536x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Two people are riding futuristic, glowing motorcycles in a neon-lit, digital environment.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://mlm361.micro.blog/uploads/2025/2024-08-26-magic-kingdom-park-tron-lightcycle-run-1536x1024.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/2024-08-26-magic-kingdom-park-tron-lightcycle-run-2-1536x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Two people are riding a futuristic motorcycle simulator with glowing blue neon lights.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://mlm361.micro.blog/uploads/2025/2024-08-26-magic-kingdom-park-tron-lightcycle-run-2-1536x1024.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/2024-08-27-epcot-france-at-epcot-2-1536x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"Three people are posing for a photo in front of a large fountain at an amusement park.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://mlm361.micro.blog/uploads/2025/2024-08-27-epcot-france-at-epcot-2-1536x1024.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/2024-08-27-epcot-france-at-epcot-4-1024x1536.jpeg\" alt=\"Three people are posing in front of a fountain at an amusement park, with a sign for Remy's Ratatouille Adventure in the background.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://mlm361.micro.blog/uploads/2025/2024-08-27-epcot-france-at-epcot-4-1024x1536.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/196053/2025/2024-08-26-magic-kingdom-park-adventureland-1-1536x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"A group of people is standing in front of Adventureland, with a small colorful figure perched on a woman's hand.\" data-microblog-lightbox=\"https://mlm361.micro.blog/uploads/2025/2024-08-26-magic-kingdom-park-adventureland-1-1536x1024.jpeg\"></div>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, that is it for now.

Why for privacy and security. I am just fed up with Microsoft, Google and AOL/Yahoo and other scanning my email and what if they ever decide to kill the product or increase the prices even more than they have recently. My own domain is shared and there is always that security problem. So I have been moving almost everything to Proton mail as it is encrypted at rest and my domains email. I am only keeping very specific things at Hotmail/Outlook and Gmail and really have moved 98 percent of the stuff I had going to AOL/Yahoo off. But companies don't make it easy sometimes. Some companies are great about letting you change your email address. They verify who you are and then verify your new email. Other companies are just terrible make it difficult and arduous so instead of still getting there emails I just unsubscribe if I really want it then I subscribe like I am new, but that has been very few. I just unsubscribe. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I am also thinking of moving away from WordPress and going to Ghost. It all depends on when I have to renew by InMotion Hosting shared plan next year. If it stays at the price they already have there it will not happen. I am probably little strain on their resources (maybe an argument can be made for email for my mom, dad and myself, but that is a hard one to make in the overall scheme of things). I will ask them if they can offer a better price as I have been with them for for over 10 years. But if they don't I will be gone. I am also going to try and update the WordPress theme shortly.

However, both companies share a penchant for shutting down consumer-oriented projects, which extends to their gaming endeavors. This review focuses on my disillusionment with recent Microsoft-backed titles, particularly from Rare and Bethesda.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sea of Thieves: Broken Promises and Grindy Gameplay</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My frustration began with Sea of Thieves. I paid $60 for a visually stunning game, only to be thrown into a confusing world lacking basic instructions. Twitch streams offered little solace, as the rampant PvP culture led to constant harassment and mockery. While some enjoyed the challenge, I, and many others, simply desired a peaceful solo or cooperative experience. The developers, Rare, initially dismissed our pleas, urging us to \"git gud.\" My argument remains: why dictate how I play a game I paid full price for, especially when PvE content offered a viable alternative? After five years, a single-player mode finally arrived, highlighting the missed opportunity for a truly inclusive experience. This isn't a free-to-play title where microtransactions dictate progress; it's a premium game, accessible via Game Pass or direct purchase.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While I applaud Rare's eventual concession to solo play, I believe full access to in-game items, except for PvP-oriented Reaper items, is essential. These rewards are earned, not gifted, and hold no tangible advantage over other players as they are just cosmetic. Those who prefer the chaotic PvPvE experience can freely enjoy it, but forcing me, or anyone else who paid for the game, to endure unwanted harassment is unacceptable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Halo Infinite: Hype Deflated, Expectations Unmet</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Halo Infinite, another Microsoft Studios title, similarly failed to live up to its pre-release hype. While enjoyable in parts, it lacked the innovation and polish expected from a flagship franchise.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Starfield: A Disappointment That Saved Me Money</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My pre-order for Starfield's \"Watch\" edition was thankfully canceled by Best Buy, potentially sparing me from further disappointment. The trailers and gameplay demos painted a picture that the final product, reminiscent of The Outer Worlds but arguably inferior, couldn't match. This experience makes me hesitant to blindly trust Microsoft's AAA marketing in the future.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moving Forward: A Cautious Gamer My recent experiences with Microsoft-backed games have instilled a sense of caution. I'll approach them with a critical eye. Until then, I'll be holding onto my hard-earned money.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n\n",

I wanted to throw that phone out a window so many times. I also didn't like that Google kills almost everything I love and use with them or let it stagnate (i.e. Blogger). I just can't trust that they won't kill the Pixel. I mean there is history. They killed the Nexus line of phones. So I went with the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra and loved the phone. It used to be not great at battery life barely getting me through a day and it is still almost quite like that but I am ending the day with slightly more battery than I had been for a couple of updates.

But due to life circumstances living in Florida and it being 14-16 hour drive away I had not been up there in over 8 years. So I got a call out of the blue from someone who lives up there and offered me a price I could not refuse. So it is done. I will miss it as it was a gorgeous piece of vacant land, but I just could not justify keeping it anymore.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The money I got for it will help pay off a majority of my bills and get me on a better tract and allow me to have a sufficient savings. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So in addition to my discontinuing posting on my Blogger site, it is also the end of an era for the land I used to own in Paris, Tennessee. I hope everyone has a great and thoughtful and thankful Memorial Day. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

While upgrading the network, I thought I had Cat5e Cable in the attic. It turned out to be Cat 5 and my Dad and myself installed it in 1995 almost 30 years ago. So now I have Cat 6 and I ran two lines with my dad's help and then made my own keystone Cat 6 jacks for the first time. A lot of people might ask why Cat 6, not 6A, or 7, or even 8. Well, I chose Cat 6 because it should be fine for my needs and  I watched several videos that Cat 7 or 8 are not official specs. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There were a few hiccups on the way but it is done.

So I figured since I am working from home 3 times a week and while Frontier Fiber has been reliable it has gone down a few times in the almost 2 years I have had it. So for that amount, it was worth having as an insurance policy. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, things are lining up and I have been learning a lot lately. WordPress, how to make keystone jacks. Hopefully more exciting things and news coming. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<p> I have been wanting to type this post for a while. I am just frustrated with how things are right now as in society at large. Inflation and what will likely be a recession next year and where have all the people gone. I know we lost about a million people that died directly or indirectly from the Pandemic but were is everyone else. Eating out right now is not a great option whether it is a fast food place or a causal dining experience. I know a lot of people left those jobs either voluntarily or involuntarily (because of shut downs and such) and went elsewhere. But the elsewheres are also having problems getting people. It just feels like people evaporated. Yet traffic has increased. Everywhere you look it looks like business are needing people but you also feel this uneasy feeling that huge layoffs are coming. I am not sure what is going on. </p><p>But to the employees in fast food. I know some of you probably hate the job because it is all you could get or you just don't care. Remember food is something we all like to eat and just imagine if you gave your family some of the food you all are pushing off on people and then people get irate. I know fast food is supposed to be fast and not a 5 star meal but it should be decent where when you bite into you go what in the world is the garbage. <br></p>\n",

It had several problems and I was really worried it was going to give out. Now, I wanted a new computer with an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X with a NVIDIA RTX 3080 with all the trimmings. But with the supply issues and the outrageous cost with everything blown out of proportion I decided to get a low end but respectable computer. I ended up with a Levono Legion AMD desktop. It has a Ryzen 7 5700G and an NVIDIA RTX 3060. It is all propriety and I wanted to stay away from it, but the case can actually hold off the shelf components and most all the reviews were positive. So I bit the bullet and had Bestbuy send me one, even though I believe this computer would be about 500 dollars cheaper if this was a couple of years ago. I have to say so far I am impressed and hope it gets me through the next 3 years if not more as I think as I believe it will take that long for prices to come back to normal and supply to return to normal or better. </p><p><br></p>\n",

I am not just talking the latest tech, but yea I haven't been able to buy a new computer as there are shortages of components and the prices are way out of whack. I am talking food shortages and what not. I see on forums people all over the Country saying no shortages here and there. But, I can tell you where I live I see it and the shelves are bare and what you do find you buy it and it turns out that it might be bad. For example a dozen eggs where bought and we cooked half of the dozen for 3 people and we all bit into the eggs and they were off tasting and bad. By the way on that batch it say large eggs and they were almost as small as Whoopers (not kidding should have taken a picture, I joke the USDA inspector must have been off that day). The next batch bought at a different store looked like large eggs and tasted fine. </p><p>I have been in Publix quite a few times and seen either completely empty shelves or sparsely populated shelves. I hope this doesn't continued but I fear it is here for other year with or without the pandemic continuing. Which quite frankly I think most people don't care anymore and are acting like it doesn't and I feel that other people feel it is over. While I will say I am fully vaccinated so I am just not worrying about dying. I don't want to catch it but I can't control other people. <br></p>\n",

So far, my biggest thing is that I wish Google would figure out a way I can say hi you know how I have the present phone set up on the home screens do the same thing. </p><p>I also have the <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6-screen-flickering-issues\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">power button screen glitch</a> when the phone is off . Since it doesn't seem to effect my phone otherwise I will wait and see what Google discovers about it or if it causes any problems. I do say the one biggest hardware flaw I see with the phone is the in display fingerprint sensor. It is awful performance. I wished Google would have stuck with the rear fingerprint sensor it was awesome had some hidden features like pulling down the notification area and was just in the right place for your finger. <br></p><p>Haven't tried the the camera's yet so can't say about the quality and will update soon as I do. The screen is gorgeous and the performance seems fluid to me. The build seems balance and very top notch as far as shape and quality of the actual phone. <br></p><p>Well there are my first raw impressions. Will keep everyone updated on the phone as time goes on. Back to personalizing the phone. Please Google improve that experience. Takes too long to setup a new phone. It is like moving everyone hates packing and unpacking.  <br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\n",

Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni should have been handed the keys to the Star Wars Universe. They have the best handle on the Star Wars Canon and tying all the Star Wars Universe Materials together. Abrams did a disservice to the Star Wars Universe. I can't wait to see how the keep Season 3 going with Grogu (aka Baby Yoda) now supposedly off. Hopefully The Manalorian keeps going for a few more seasons and we see an older Grogu that can catch back up with Mando and the gang and due stuff.Again, that was a great Season Finale. Thanks to all who work on this series it is a need break in my week to watch this Series, my only complaint what happened to a series being 20-23 episodes a year 😀?</p><p>Star Trek Discovery also had their Season Finale. It wasn't as great but there was some interesting tidbits in there to the past. I just wish they would either pick a strategy or if they are going to mix it up with the action and exploration it would be a little more woven together. I understand why they had to do the last 2 episodes but I think they could have done them earlier and it would have fit in better and again a Series like Star Trek should be longer than 10 episodes a Season. </p><p>Finally I understand this year why there will be more time between Seasons but honestly before this year there is no excuse. TV Seasons used to be three to four months. Now we are going up to a year (before the pandemic hit) or longer. Come on TV people get it together. </p><p> </p><p> <br></p><p><br></p>\n",

Thanks to my coworker, boss and my family for everything. Thanks to Jesus and God for saying it was not time for me to go. </p> <p>Apparently this is common and serious. My weight had nothing to do with it. My hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) may have contributed to the A-Fib, but it certainly did not help. </p> <p>I am currently on an antiarrhythmic and a blood thinner.

I have had to endure several pay cuts in the last few months. Work has had to lay off more than 200 people because of this IMPROVING economy. I fear more cuts are coming and technically I did not get laid off. However, my position on the night shift was eliminated and they were able to transfer on top of another pay cut. Now they have increased our insurance premiums, co-insurance and the amount we paid. I used to think the 80-20 split was bad. We now have a 70-30 split and in some causes 50-50 with a increase of the deductible of course. I thought healthcare was supposed to be recession and depression proof. Well, that is it for now.

				"content_text": "<p>Well, it is another year. I pray this one is a lot better than last year. I was reflecting last night how if I was still in law enforcement, I would have only 4 years to go to full retirement. However, I don’t know if I would have lived longer than 5 years after that. I would probably be about 250 to 260 pounds. Plus have full blown diabetes and still probably would have had glaucoma in my right eye. On top of that the citizens of Hillsborough County would have drove me nuts. </p> <p>I am thankful to the Lord for telling me to leave when I did. I have pre-diabetes. Still have glaucoma in my right eye and have lost 26 pounds in the last year. I did it slowly over the course of the year and I am maintaining my weight. I plan on talking to my doctor again and see if I can go back on the Phenteramine. I seem to hold my weight once I lose it thanks to the those pills. </p> <p>I am hoping to pay down more debt this year. I am hoping. I pray that the Lord will give me enough of a pay raise to help accomplish a 15 percent reduction in my overall debt. I would like to also build up a reserve this year of at least 10 percent of my salary. I would also like to use cash to pay for as much as possible. By the end of the year I hope I can reach these goals along with being at 199 pounds in weight. I would also like to be able to start back to College to head to my goal within the next five years to finally graduate and get a job in the IT industry. My long term goal is to be living in Paris, Tennessee by the time I am 52. Let’s pray all this works out. </p> <p>That is my short term and long term goals for the years to come. Hope everyone had a great New Year’s Eve. I worked but it was an easy night. So, easy I can’t even sleep today. </p><div style=\"margin:0px; padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\">\n<br><br><br>\n</div>\n",

Next month looks to be the same. Also, I will start a new position at Moffitt at the end of June or the beginning of July. It will require me to work midnights again. But, I thought I would mind. But, I don’t. It means more money, not actually a pay raise but shift differential. This should add about 10000 in yearly income, at least I hope. Second, I will be working basically a Monday through Friday shift. I will be off every Saturday and Sunday night. I am looking forward to it. </p>  <p>I work on Monday, Memorial Day. But, that is ok. I will be getting time and a half. Also, I downloaded the new official, not beta, version of Microsoft Office 2010. I like it. It is way better than Office 2007. Only feature I miss is from Office 2003, where you can change the stationary in Outlook. I got it for 9.95 from the Microsoft Use at Home program through work. However, I will still have to buy a shrink wrap version as on of my computers I am using 64 bit for almost everything. </p>  <p>On the weight front. I have not lost any more, but, haven’t gained anymore either. I am holding steady. I think my body is becoming used to the Phenteramine. However, I am not showing any signs of needing it every day. I skip yesterday’s dose all together. My appetite did not increase so that’s good. </p>  <p>Well, that is it for now. Remember you can follow me on Twitter. Stop by my website and follow me other ways. I am going to strive to blog and twitter more through out the year. I am contemplating deleting my Facebook account.

However, I know where McCain is coming from. Obama is a great Orator but that is it. When pressed he is never specific. I also fear he would give into other nations because he is afraid to get us in a war even though it maybe for the right reason. The Iraq War was wrong to start but we must finish it or breed a 1000 more terrorist that will hurt us. <br>We need people in Congress who is going to not only say he is going to look out for the \"little guy\" but recognize who the \"little guy\" is and start telling big business about their many unfair business practices. Such as telling banks they are not going to charge any more ATM fees. It cost them almost nothing to run these things and if I bank with Bank A and go to Bank B because it is closer I should not have to pay. Because I can guarantee you that a Bank B customer will use Banks A ATM and it works out in the end. That is just one of the number of ways Americans are being bleed dry by Corporations. <br>I have a book full.\n",

The diagnoses with the ultrasound and MRI was a minimal fatty liver and a benign polyp in my gallbladder. Well, my doctor was going to start me on Tricor to lower my triglycerides. However, after another abnormal liver blood test sent me to a gastroenterologist. He had me go to Labcorp and I gave 9 vials of blood. Well, guess what. Some of the tests were abnormal. But, no hepatitis A, B or C. Which I knew was negative. Well getting back to my scopes today. I had a good experience at the place it was performed and the doctor is very good. He did find a growth in my stomach and my colon. He biopsied both. I do have diverticula in one area and I have hemorrhoids. The later I knew I had. I got to see color pictures of everything. I am going to ask when I see him on February 9th if I can have a copy of them. His office is supposed to call me and let me know of the outcome of the biopsies.

				"content_text": "<div align=\"justify\">Well, yesterday was a day of bad news and today continued the trend. I went in for a physical back on June 2, 2005. The nurse from my doctor called me and woke me up after I had gotten home late and had only about 3 to 3.5 hours sleep when she called. She started out the telephone conversation Mr. Mitchell we need you to come in for additional blood work and the doctor is writing a script for a ultrasound of your liver. He thinks something is wrong with your liver and your liver panels are why out of wack  and the doctor thinks you might have hepatitis. Well, to say the least I was wide awake then, I started to ask questions like how could I have hepatitis when I have had the inoculations for hepatitis B and that I was exposed to blood last year at work several times. But, I went for the 6 months of required blood draws and they all were negative. So, I am thinking the worst case scenario. After 4 and a half hours of no sleep and continuous telephone calls to and from the doctors office. The nurse finally calls be back and states that the doctor doesn't think I have hepatitis. He is having the ultrasound and other blood tests to make sure my liver is healthy and in good condition because he is going to start me on cholesterol medication. My cholesterol is 252 and my weight is a big factor in all this. So, I felt like a hundred pound weight have been lifted off of my shoulders. Then I wanted to punch that nurse out because she had caused me to panic. I go Friday for more blood work and will schedule the ultrasound for hopefully sometime next week. I will keep you informed. <br><br>Bad news week continued.....<br>I took Henry to the Eye Vet today and his pressure is high again. However, since he is in no obvious pain there is nothing that can be done except continued the medication and have him rechecked for monitoring. His eye has enlarged but otherwise is intact. The Vet believes that the eye enlarging is probably keeping him from being in pain. His nerves also might be dead which would cause no pain. So, I guess this could be considered mixed news. <br><br>Other bad things that happened last week.....<br>I had to go back to my eye doctor. The prescription and my new glasses were not working. Come to find out the prescription was too strong. Usually the doctor double checks the nurse's findings before I leave. But this year she didn't. So, after getting the proper prescription I took my glasses back and having the lenses redone. Luckily, I am not going to have to pay for it. <br>\n</div>\n",

They got a little heat exhaustion I believe. <br>We had a good time but my Mom got sick on the way home. <br>I have a lot of new DVD's that I will be watching over the next couple of weeks. I will also have a busy schedule. I am hoping it will come down in the middle to end of June. So, just a warning I may not get the website updated for June by the end of June and may just update it for July. <br>Well, I hope all my friends and family are doing good. Would love to receive E-mail from y'all. Take care for now. <br>And by the way, I took a couple of pictures on my camera phone the other day and have posted them up on my MOB, so check them up.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Well, I took Henry to the Eye Vet yesterday. He stitches came out fine and the Eye Vet says all looks well on that front. However, his right eye the pressure has increased to 40 even after the increase in medicine. Unlike his left eye though his vision is good in that eye and it is clear. The Eye Vet has increased the only other medication he can to see if that will help. We go back in 3 weeks. I will have to take the day off or cancel a doctor appointment I have the following week and take him them. If the eye pressure increases or stays high I have 2 options both costly. One would be to try and use some type of cyro procedure on the eye to see if the glaucoma can be stopped and reversed (but no guarantees) the other have the eye taken out like the left. But, the last option makes Henry permanently blind although the cyro option could too. Either way his sight has just a few more months maybe 6 months to a year. At least when he loses the other eye he will be probably be healthier and happier because he will not be on such strong medication.</p>\n",

But, because of my job and because I always have been Introverted. I don&rsquo;t like being around people. Especially, strangers. It takes a while to get to know people and once I am comfortable with people I am fine. So, this is one reason that I do not attend Church. There are a couple of more. Also, due to my job, when I am off it is down time for me and I have to admit I like to be lazy which links back to reason one getting to know people takes a lot of effort and I have been disappointed on many occasions with people. Which brings me to my third reason. People lie. I don&rsquo;t mean a little &ldquo;white&rdquo; lie like that is a good color when it really is isn&rsquo;t, but hypocritical lying. I deal with liars on my job all day long. But, then does this mean my love for Christ is any less genuine. I think not. I constantly listen to Christian music and shows while working, via the radio. So, I get my spiritual renewal and food from that source. I read the Internet visiting Christian links to gather information. I read, via e-mail, daily my devotional. So, yes I am being fed. Yes, I know the reason to attend Church is not only to be fed Spiritually but to fellowship with the people bonded by the same things that bond all Christian. The salvation Christ the Lord has given us and we should draw strength in that.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The reason I bring all this up is I saw Passions for Christ a couple of weeks ago and it was an awesome movie. This movie can spiritually feed you for a while. It had me thinking tonight as every night, but more so tonight, that the suffering Christ submitted and allowed for me was unbelievable. I have to think that if I lived in the days that this happened and I know I would be follower of Christ back then to that I would have intercede somehow, even for a brief moment, to stop the pain and torture Christ had to endure for us. Yes, I know that I would have been killed but you know that would have been fine. Because I know where I am heading upon death. Death, even old age, these things don&rsquo;t bother me. Pain, torture to me and suffering that Our Christ went through, that bothers me. If you haven&rsquo;t seen the movie yet go see it. It was amazing to see and hear the audience. No one in the theater talked during the movie after the first 15 minutes. Some teenagers were sitting next to me and were laughing and talking and even making fun of the movies subtitles. But, after 15 minutes. There was absolutely no sound, other than the movie, and no one got up to go to the concession stand or the bathroom.

He said that his left eye was inflamed but he did not think it was from anything to do with glaucoma. He said he could not rule out a pressure spike but more than likely since Henry is blind in that eye he either hit it or poke it on something. The Eye Vet gave me an anti inflammatory to use for 10 days. He said that no other medicine is needed in the eye because it is dead and the pressure is not a problem anymore.

I still will recommend DELL even though they wouldn't warranty my speakers!!!!!<br>For Christmas I got some socks, gift cards and cash. I hope everybody got what they wanted. That is what I wanted and got. Henry got a chew toy. Take care everyone and maybe blog some more tomorrow if I feel up to it.\n",

Well, no it was back up in the 40&rsquo;s. So they medicine worked for a while. I have come to the hard conclusion that I am going to have to a procedure done just to his left eye that would basically kill that eye. That way he is in no pain. He will be blind in that eye but will not be in pain and not have to take medicine that is not working. I can tell when the eye bothers him he whines. The other alternative was to try a procedure that saves the eye. However, it is not guarantee to work and stick and it costs $1500 and up depending on how long he has to stay at the Vets. Usually it is 3 days. But, again no guarantee. Also, the Vet is unsure if he has lost any vision and is just see shadows in that eye. They have no way of telling if he has lost vision. The other procedure to kill the eye takes only a few minutes is not that invasive and will take about a couple weeks to kill the eye. Henry would only be on medication to help comfort the eye until it dies. This procedure costs $650 and is guarantee to end the pain. He will still have the right eye and the pressures in that eye have remained low and the right eye did not have complications. The left eye did and has had all bad things happened to it. The right eye was quite healthy when the cataract was removed and the cataract was very small in that eye. So, he will have one good eye. I think I am going have to do the least costly and ultimately the best thing for him. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I saw a completed blind dog at the eye Vet the other day and he got around pretty good.

I have to get up at 2 AM every morning then again at 8 AM to give it to him.\n<br>I watched an excellent movie last night, The Bourne Identity. Very good. Matt Damon really does a good job with the part. I hope there is a sequel. \n<br>I might get a pay per view movie tonight not sure. I hate football and there is nothing on because of the Super Bowl.\n",
